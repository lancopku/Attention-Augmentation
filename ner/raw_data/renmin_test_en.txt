RMB Exchange Rate and Southeast Asian Financial Turbulence
The financial turmoil in Southeast Asia since July last year has attracted wide attention from various countries
Triggered this crisis
This view is obviously inconsistent with the actual situation
About 80% of China’s foreign exchange resources are calculated and allocated based on market prices in foreign exchange swaps
Secondly
Take the road of profitable development
The export proportion of primary products dropped from 22.5% to 14.5%
The decline in export competitiveness of Southeast Asian countries is not directly related to the unification of the RMB exchange rate
From 1990 to 1995, the average annual growth rate of its exports was still 19%
Thailand's current account balance is a structural problem
To make up for the long-term current account deficit
Cause exchange rate overvaluation
For example, in the total capital inflow of Thailand in 1996,
Short-term capital will quickly withdraw
The balance of payments is in good condition
And work hard to reduce tariffs
And in recent years, my country’s trade and capital account balances have a large surplus

The price increase in my country increased from 18.5% and 17.8% in 1988 and 1989.
This is not a low speed in the world

There are many reasons for the above problems
It is impossible to conduct in-depth analysis here

Maintain high growth for a long time
The current economic growth rate of 8%-9% is not a low rate
This is compared to high growth with moisture
The current economic structure of our country is seriously unreasonable
But an attempt to relax money simply
If this drives up prices
not difficult to see
The growth mode of extensive management does not adapt to domestic and foreign market changes and severe market competition
What's more, the prices of most commodities in my country, especially the prices of industrial products, have been basically liberalized.

Works with realist critical spirit
After the drama is combined with the reality of our country
People exposed to drama
Have a solemn duty to inspire the people to unite and forge ahead
The socialist spirit has its unique advantages in educating the people

In terms of ideology, there is still a tendency to dilute the theme and go straight to the theme

Why go deep into life
Makes many works that reflect reality look dry and dry
Therefore
In addition to striving to achieve the above two requirements
With the strong support and care of superior leaders
It is also an affirmation and support for military drama
I want to talk about the following issues that need attention
Although military drama has done some useful discussions in the past
Formally gives a sense of antiquities
In order to create more and better drama masterpieces with a unified ideological and artistic quality
Understand them
Capture the excitement of drama creation in their emotions
Developing drama theory

on
Comrades in the drama circle have attached great importance to a new subject: when the planned economy is transitioning to a socialist market economy
The development of drama needs the care and support of the party and the country
Military drama is an inseparable and important aspect of the entire Chinese drama art industry.
1927
Comrade Deng Xiaoping watched "Thousands of Waters and Thousand Mountains" by Zongzheng Repertory Troupe in the 1970s
Chinese drama has advantages and difficulties
We must start from this height
New viewpoints recognized by political economy circles
Point out that Deng Xiaoping’s economic theory has broken through some major theoretical issues in Marxist political economy
(3) On the essence of socialism
(4) On the fundamental tasks of socialism
(6) Economic subject theory
The report of the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China clearly stated this:
It shows that there are new and deeper insights into the understanding of the nature of the socialist economy
Under this premise
Discussion hotspots mainly include the property rights theory of "Das Kapital"
Explain the practical significance and function of the study of "Das Kapital" from different angles
Northwestern University He Liancheng thinks
Is also the biggest difficulty
Effectively solve the triangle debt problem
A comprehensive and systematic analysis of the practical problems facing the reform of state-owned enterprises
Therefore, how to understand this phenomenon and how to understand Deng Xiaoping’s theory of common prosperity has become an extremely important topic in the study of political economy.
The gap in legal income should not only be eliminated, but protection should be emphasized
The Trend of Political Economics Research
Actively absorb all the fruits of human civilization
Imitating the methods of western economics in theoretical paradigm
Diversification of research methods
Recently, he published a treatise to further explain and develop his views.
Now what he is concerned about is how Western civilization itself should respect itself
or
The view that Westernization is a global phenomenon
Has its own unique characteristics
Western civilization includes inheriting ancient cultural heritage
Christian
Separation of spiritual and secular authority
Western civilization cannot be copied
Huntington thinks
Time for a civilization of cohesion and vitality
Same economy
State conflicts are increasingly manifested as conflicts triggered by cultural and social values
Clash of civilizations
The clash of civilizations is bound to accompany politics in a certain sense
Recently, the Public Policy Research Center of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences held in Beijing
Ideology and Concepts of Rural Grassroots Cadres
The construction of the legal system of villager autonomy is lagging behind
Trial

since
my country’s macroeconomic theoretical research emphasizes the interaction between theory and practice
Great progress has been made in establishing China's macroeconomic system
Make its research direction
at the same time
Only then can we better provide the abstract ability to absorb practical experience to form a new theoretical system
Highlight its macroscopic and overall subject characteristics
Our macroeconomic theoretical research
Develop closer ties with the international economy
Coordinating economic policies
Is consistent with historical materialism
Improve moral realm and human dignity
Today when people are more concerned about their material interests and material enjoyment
Value is subjective
Naturally have different values
Another opinion is that
The decisive role of values ​​are the interests and positions of the subject
It's a matter of historical rationality
"Chinese Socialism in the Process of World Modernization"
The book also demonstrates Deng Xiaoping Theory and Marxism-Leninism
Point out that Deng Xiaoping Theory is adhering to Marxism-Leninism

Editor's note: The U.S. economy has been more than 81 months since it resumed growth in March 1991.
Features and Causes of U.S. Economic Growth
Since entering the 90s
Industries that have declined in competitiveness in previous years, such as finance, have regained vitality
Export expansion
Unilateral pressure
More than 40% are computers
The expansion of export trade has become an important source of economic growth for the United States this time
But there has been a double-high fiscal and trade deficit that existed throughout the 1980s.
Does not mean the disappearance of the business cycle
nice
New economy
New economy
It does not mean that the business cycle no longer exists
The main difference with the traditional economy is: the industrial structure is further advanced and softened
Since the early 1980s
Twice higher than Western Europe
If we say that the driving force behind the development of the U.S. economy in the past was the housing construction industry and the automobile industry
Does not mean that the business cycle is gone
Drive the U.S. economy to continue to grow for 106 months
Large-scale arms expansion in the United States and the Soviet Union
There is no sign of a major economic downturn in the foreseeable near future
Falling prices stimulate demand
From 1991 to 1996
Among the 50 most profitable large companies in the world
New economy
It is also much lower than the share of other developed countries’ fiscal deficits in their GDP
The United States is not only serving foreign countries
U.S. foreign direct investment income reached 85.54 billion US dollars that year
Use financial leverage for macro-control
Deep-seated problems restricting the expansion of the US economy (1 picture attached)
And pay attention to its impact on the business cycle
These issues will become the basic factors restricting the expansion of the US economy and the continuation of the cycle
The austerity macro-control policies certainly played a role in curbing inflation
Eliminate huge fiscal deficits
The rate of monetary expansion slowed down significantly in the past three years
Especially the currency that is important for maintaining the operation of the economy
In particular, the operating account of the Ministry of Finance (referring to income minus expenditures other than net interest) is the best measure of the government’s influence on the economy.
Second, the instability of the domestic financial system has increased
This is reflected in the trend of changes in U.S. public and private savings and liabilities
Once foreign investors withdraw funds from the U.S. securities market
Decrease to 4.8% in the first quarter of 1997
There were more than one million bankruptcies in 1996
Resulting in bank distress and financial tightening
New structural changes in the economies of developed countries
New energy industry
Its economic activity still has obvious cyclical fluctuations
The extent of this decline will be lessened
During this period, the real wages of the low-income class decreased at an annual rate of 1.3%
But the reality is
Not only be wary of a renewed inflation
It gives us a more comprehensive and clear understanding of the current US economic situation and future trends.
