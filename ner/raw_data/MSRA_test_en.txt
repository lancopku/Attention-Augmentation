Our reporter Zeng Kun reports: Member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, met with representatives attending the second council meeting of the first session of the China Guangcai Industry Promotion Association today
I hope that more people in the non-public economy will devote themselves to the glorious cause
True love
Show love
Make a contribution
At today's meeting
Liu Yonghao and other 25 non-public economic representatives won the "Glorious Career Medal"
This is the first time since the implementation of the Guangcai Undertaking for more than three years to commend the outstanding contributions of non-public economic personnel
Li Ruihuan congratulated and respected the winners and the newly elected leaders of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce
He said
The report of the 15th National Congress of the Party clearly stated
Public ownership
Multi-ownership economy develops together
It is a basic economic system in the primary stage of socialism in our country
Non-public ownership economy is an important part of my country's socialist market economy
This means
The non-public ownership economy will not only exist for a long time in the primary stage of socialism
And will get lasting
Healthy development
This means
Serve as a bridge and link between the party and the government to connect with non-public ownership
As government management
Assistant to guide the non-public economy
The task of the Federation of Industry and Commerce is more onerous
Status is more important
I hope comrades study hard
Deeply understand the spirit of the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
Promoting the healthy development of non-public ownership economy
Strengthen the ideological and political work of non-public economic personnel
Spend more time
Some more ideas
Make more contributions
He said
For several years
A large number of people in the non-public sector of the economy have participated in the glorious cause
Did a lot of work
Achieved remarkable results
Created a lot of good experiences
Many touching stories and advanced characters have emerged
Guangcai Career has won the respect of people
Received praise from all walks of life
The central government has also given attention and support
Li Ruihuan says
Since the reform and opening up
We allow and encourage some people and some areas to get rich first
Because some people get rich first is a shortcut to achieve common prosperity
Don't allow some people to get rich first
The result can only be common poverty
Getting rich first is not only beneficial to the rich first
to the society
For the long term
The whole is also favorable
Getting rich first is reasonable and legal
Beyond reproach
But the first rich are a minority after all
It's impossible for everyone to get rich in the short term
At the same time, some people will have a harder life
What to do after getting rich
We believe
Those who get rich first should serve the country
serve the society
Dedication to the hearts of the people
Use your talents and strength to help those who are not rich
Poor people
Guangcai Career is an effective form of helping the rich before the rich
It is the Chinese nation’s traditional virtues of helping the poor in the new situation.
It is also a pioneering effort to combine economic behavior with moral behavior under the conditions of a socialist market economy
Has far-reaching significance
Broad prospects for development
I hope there will be more people in the non-public economy who get rich first
Dedicated to the glorious career
True love
Show love
Make a contribution
Hope United Front Work Department
The Federation of Industry and Commerce seriously sums up the experience
Strengthen organizational leadership
Improve the service system

Mankind is about to enter the 21st century
Sum up the past
face to the future
We need to establish cooperation concepts and methods that conform to the trend of the times
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
Is the most influential economic forum in the region
It is also one of the most dynamic economic cooperation organizations in the world

This is: Fully respect the diversity of members
Acknowledge the differences in development levels and stages of development among members and the different benefits and needs they bring

Conducive to a better balance of the different rights and requirements of each member
Contribute to the ability of each member
Promote common development
Stick to this way
It is an important guarantee for APEC members to strengthen cooperation
The only mission of APEC
Is to develop economic cooperation
It is not appropriate to extend the scope of discussion to society
political
Security and other non-economic areas
Adhere to the principle of doing something and not doing something
Concentrate on promoting economic cooperation
Trade and investment liberalization is relative to any member
Conditional
Need to fully consider the differences between members and the actual situation
Insist on voluntary
mutual benefit
Principle of consensus

Independent decision
volunteer
At the same time recognize the difference between the two schedules
Consider self-interest

Advocate developed members to help developing members with their economic and technological advantages
Without prejudice to their interests
Only in this way
Can be both a developed member
Also create more cooperation opportunities for developing members
Economic and technological cooperation and trade and investment liberalization are closely integrated

The rapid development of contemporary science and technology
Has become the most decisive factor in promoting the development of productivity
Have a profound impact on the world economy and social life
Strive to strengthen scientific and technological exchanges
Technical cooperation and technology transfer
It is beneficial to developing members to improve their economic and technological strength
It is also conducive to developed members to enhance the stamina of sustainable economic development
This can not only narrow the development gap between members
It can also effectively promote the process of trade and investment liberalization
to this end
I would like to make four points:
One
Fully open the technology trade market
Promote technical cooperation and technology transfer among members
Remove man-made obstacles
Eliminate discriminatory policies and practices
two
Take necessary measures
Encourage and accelerate the transfer of high and new technology to all members, especially developing members
To facilitate the economic and technological progress of developing members
three
All members must pay attention to protecting intellectual property rights
And make the intellectual property system more rational
Appropriate time for technology patent protection
The transfer conditions must be fair
four
It is recommended that APEC should formulate an "Agenda for Cooperation in the Technology Industry towards the 21st Century"
This agenda
Goals and principles
There must be practical measures and steps
Strive to combine market orientation with government regulation
Combine development research and achievement transformation
Comprehensively promote the integration of specific cooperation projects
In order to start the process of Asia-Pacific economic and technological cooperation
The recent financial turmoil in Southeast Asia
Spread to many parts of the world
Aroused widespread concern in the international community
From the past and present international financial turmoil
We can all get many useful enlightenments
The normal and safe operation of the financial system
Essential to the overall economic stability and development
In order to maintain normal financial order
Prevent financial risks
Not only must there be a correct economic development strategy
Maintain a reasonable economic structure
And to improve the financial system
Strengthen financial supervision
And according to the actual situation
Maintain an appropriate scale and reasonable structure of foreign debt
Gradually open up capital markets and financial services
Strengthen regional and global financial cooperation
Maintain normal international financial order
Jointly prevent the impact of excessive international hot money speculation
Create a good financial environment
Good for all countries
We take a positive attitude towards strengthening regional financial cooperation in Asia
Willing to participate in discussions about cooperation mechanisms
Economic Development in Southeast Asia
Due to the current financial market turmoil
Encountered temporary difficulties
But after summing up experience
Make appropriate adjustments
The vitality of Southeast Asian economic development will be further revealed
The outlook is optimistic
We have confidence in it
Since 1993
China has repeatedly lowered tariffs independently
Tariffs dropped by 60% in five years
Since October 1 this year
China’s average tariff level has dropped to 17%
Chinese government decided
By 2005
Reduce the average tariff on industrial products to 10%
China decided to join the "Information Technology Agreement"
And start negotiations on related matters
Our practical actions
I believe it will promote the development of economic and technological cooperation and trade and investment liberalization in the Asia-Pacific region
At last
I would like to warmly welcome the 9th APEC Leaders’ Informal Meeting held in Shanghai, China in 2001
We will fully prepare for the meeting

(Xinhua News Agency, Shenzhen, June 30th)
"Cross-Strait Relations" published a signed article proposed
Early political negotiations to promote the development of cross-strait relations
According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 13th, the recently published "Cross-Strait Relations" magazine published an article entitled "Early Start of Political Negotiations" in the October issue
A signed article in Promoting the Development of Cross-Strait Relations
On both sides of the strait under the one-China principle
Officially end the hostilities
Expressed opinions on early political negotiations
The article says
When General Secretary Jiang Zemin talked about the peaceful reunification of the motherland in the political report of the 15th CPC National Congress
Solemnly appeal again
: As the first step
Both sides of the strait can be first
Under the one China principle
Officially end the state of hostility across the strait
Negotiate
Hope Taiwan
Respond seriously

Engage in political negotiations
Vice Premier Qian Qichen also recently proposed
I hope that the Taiwan authorities will promptly consult with us on the procedural arrangements for cross-strait political negotiations.
This is the Communist Party of China and the motherland government to promote the development of cross-strait relations
It is also for the peaceful settlement of political differences between the two sides of the strait
The solemn decision made to advance the peaceful reunification process
It fully embodies the broad mind of the CPC Central Committee

It also reflects the eagerness of compatriots on both sides of the strait to end the state of hostility across the strait as soon as possible
The wish to improve and develop cross-strait relations
Therefore, it has once again received a warm response from Taiwan compatriots and high attention from the international community.
Taiwan should make a serious response
Early political negotiations with the motherland
The article states
Political negotiation is to resolve cross-strait differences
Stabilize and develop cross-strait relations
The only way to gradually advance the great cause of peaceful reunification of the motherland
The article says
Under the one China principle
Resolve political differences between the two sides of the strait through political negotiations
Promote the reunification of the motherland
It is the consistent proposition of the Chinese Communist Party and the government to solve the Taiwan issue
To realize this claim
The mainland of the motherland started in the early 1990s
According to the development and changes of Taiwan situation and cross-strait relations
The policy of political negotiations has been adjusted accordingly
Mainly reflected in the following two aspects:
One is on the negotiation partner
Experienced from advocating negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to being led by the Kuomintang and the Communist Party
Invite other parties
Political negotiations involving groups and representatives
Then to the development process of cross-strait political negotiations proposed in the eight proposals of General Secretary Jiang Zemin
The second is in terms of negotiation content
I have also experienced advocating discussions from the 1979 "Report to Compatriots in Taiwan"
End the cross-strait military standoff
In the report of the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
Officially end the state of hostility across the strait
Gradually achieve peaceful reunification
Negotiate
Then General Secretary Jiang Zemin put forward in the eight propositions
As the first step
Both parties can first
Under the one China principle
Officially end the state of hostility across the strait
Negotiate
Development process
This fully demonstrates that the Chinese Communist Party and the government have been unswervingly pragmatic for many years
Sincere attitude
Flexible ways to facilitate cross-strait political negotiations
The determination to advance the process of peaceful reunification of the motherland
To improve and develop cross-strait relations
Under the one China principle
Discuss the main problems affecting the development of cross-strait relations
Find a way to resolve differences
Many years
The authorized non-governmental organization Cross-Strait Relations Association and Taiwan
Straits Exchange Foundation
Conducted many transactional discussions
To promote the development of cross-strait relations
Safeguard the rights and interests of compatriots on both sides of the strait
Played a positive and important role
But the Taiwan side repeatedly raised the issue in the meeting
Jurisdiction
Political issues
Make it difficult for the two sessions to make progress
Facts have proved
The main crux of the talks between the two sessions in the past few years is actually a political issue
therefore
If you don’t face political differences and try to find a solution
Transactional negotiations are also difficult to achieve satisfactory results
Only to start political negotiations between the two sides of the strait as soon as possible
Resolve political differences between the two sides under the one-China principle
It is possible to lay a solid foundation for the benign interaction and stable development of cross-strait relations
Create favorable conditions for the ultimate realization of the peaceful reunification of the two sides of the strait
The article believes that political negotiations should use the end of cross-strait hostility as a breakthrough
The article says
Cross-strait political negotiations can be divided into stages
Step by step
First of all, we should start with the elimination of cross-strait hostilities that have lasted for nearly half a century.
This is the common wish of compatriots on both sides of the strait
Is a key issue for the further development of cross-strait relations
So General Secretary Jiang Zemin’s eight propositions
Solemn proposal
In the political report of the 15th CPC National Congress
Solemnly appeal again
: As the first step
Both sides of the strait can be first
Under the one China principle
Officially end the state of hostility across the strait
Negotiate
And reach an agreement
on the basis of
Shared obligations
Safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity
And plan the future development of cross-strait relations
Talking from the official ending of hostilities across the strait
Can create a good security environment for the development of cross-strait relations
Can solve the vital interests of Taiwan compatriots
Can make overall plans and implement cross-strait relations
therefore
This proposition captures the main contradiction as a breakthrough
Completely in line with the vital interests of compatriots on both sides of the strait
To enable political negotiations to proceed in a prepared manner
First of all, we should consult on the procedural arrangements for cross-strait political negotiations
It is absolutely necessary
And it's feasible
The article emphasizes
In line with the one-China principle
Show true sincerity
The article says
In January 1995, General Secretary Jiang Zemin proposed that the first step
Under the one China principle
Officially end the state of hostility across the strait
After negotiation
Taiwan refuses this
After the cross-strait relations suddenly became tense in the middle of the same year due to well-known reasons
Taiwan has expressed its intention to officially end the cross-strait hostilities.
Said to give priority to the issue of ending cross-strait hostilities
Recently
Some important figures in Taiwan have repeatedly stated clearly that political issues can be discussed
The most important
The top priority is to end the hostilities
Sign a peace agreement
but
To this attitude
Some people in Taiwan are opposed to it
The article thinks
As long as there is sincerity on both sides of the strait
And can truly be rational
Pragmatic attitude
Efforts to seek consensus from the following aspects
Will break the current deadlock in cross-strait political negotiations
One is to follow the one China principle
This is for the fact that there is indeed such a force on the island of Taiwan and internationally
Always want to divide China's sovereignty
Always want to separate Taiwan from Chinese territory
Therefore, this principle should be adhered to in transactional negotiations
Political negotiations should be based on this principle
The ARATS has always advocated that the one-China principle should be expressed in transactional negotiations.
But it is not necessary to discuss the political meaning of one China
on the basis of
ARATS and SEF are in business talks
Both sides of the strait adhere to the one-China principle
Reach an oral consensus
The article states
About before the reunification of the two sides of the strait
One China
Political connotation
General Secretary Jiang Zemin's speech on "Continue to Strive to Promote the Reunification of the Motherland" issued on January 30, 1995
Has been very clear
That is: there is only one China
Taiwan is part of China
China's sovereignty and territorial integrity are inseparable
Against any manufacturing
Taiwan independence
Words and deeds
Also opposed
Divide and conquer
Phase Two China
Other claims
The second is to insist on equal consultation
The mainland of the motherland started by proposing cross-strait political negotiations
Make it clear that it is the Kuomintang and the Communist Party
Peer negotiation
General Secretary Jiang Zemin emphasized in the eight propositions
As for the name of political negotiations
location
Ways and other issues
As long as early consultation on an equal footing
Always find a solution acceptable to both parties
Everything says
The mainland of the motherland has always adhered to the principle of equal consultation under the framework of one China
There is no need to negotiate with Taiwan in the name of the central and local authorities
And didn’t put up a pose of bullying
But to fully understand Taiwan’s mentality and situation
Try to avoid problems that it feels inconvenient
Taiwan should not have any worries on this issue
Not to deliberately distort
Extranodal branches
General Secretary Jiang Zemin also emphasized in the report to the 15th CPC National Congress
Under the premise of one China
Any questions can be discussed
As long as the opinions and suggestions are conducive to the reunification of the motherland
Can bring it up
The third is that cross-strait political negotiations do not allow foreign forces to intervene
put one's oar in
Reunification of the two sides of the strait is China's internal affair
Naturally, the Chinese on both sides of the strait should solve it by themselves
Never allow foreign forces to interfere
General Secretary Jiang Zemin said in the report of the 15th National Congress:
Except for a few stubborn persistence
Taiwan independence
Stand outside
Welcome to all parties in Taiwan
People from all walks of life exchange views with us on cross-strait relations and peaceful reunification
The mainland of the motherland has always welcomed all parties in Taiwan
People from all walks of life exchange opinions
Simultaneously
I hope that Taiwan’s response to General Secretary Jiang Zemin’s
Solemnly appeal again
Make serious
Clear response
The head of the ARATS stated in September last year
If the political atmosphere on both sides of the strait is right
ARATS is willing to fight for authorization
Procedural arrangements for cross-strait political negotiations
Discuss with SEF
After Taiwan’s clear response to General Secretary Jiang Zemin’s solemn appeal at the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China,
The two sessions should be authorized
Procedural negotiations for political negotiations as soon as possible
Resolve issues in cross-strait political negotiations
The name of the negotiation and other issues
Time does not wait
We hope that Taiwan will seize the opportunity
Rationally
Pragmatic attitude
In line with the people on both sides of the strait
The spirit of being responsible to the Chinese nation
Face up and cherish this opportunity
Make wise choices

At the 4th ASEAN Regional Forum
Qian Qichen expounded my views and positions on the Asia-Pacific situation
Xinhua News Agency, Bidalling Jaya (Malaysia), July 27th, Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen delivered an important speech at the Fourth ASEAN Regional Forum held here today
The full text of the speech is as follows:
Mr.president
The situation in the Asia-Pacific region
Countries are very concerned
Trends in recent developments in the region
I want to emphasize the following points:
———With Laos
Joining of Myanmar
ASEAN organization expanded
As an emerging force
ASEAN plays a unique and important role in regional affairs
--- Positive changes in the situation on the Korean Peninsula
The four-party talks process is about to start
This contributes to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and the Asia-Pacific region
--- China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong
Is a major event of international attention
The return of Hong Kong further strengthens China's ties with Asia and the world
Will further promote peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region
———The momentum of dialogue and cooperation among countries is on the rise
Maintain regional stability
The political will to settle disputes by peaceful means is increasing
———The economic ties within and between regions are becoming wider and closer
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
The Asia-Europe Meeting and others are transforming consensus on cooperation into practical actions
of course
There are still some unstable factors in this area
Some old hot issues are once again highlighted
Armed conflict in Cambodia is cause for concern
Emerging transnational issues present new challenges
If these problems cannot be properly handled
Will adversely affect regional peace and stability
Mr.president
As an important channel for discussing security issues in the Asia-Pacific region
The ASEAN Regional Forum is enhancing mutual understanding and trust among countries
Made a positive contribution to promoting regional peace and stability
Currently
The forum has entered an important period of connecting the past and the next
There are many expectations for the development of the forum
We believe
The forum should always start from the reality of the region
To maintain regional peace and security as the goal
Treat each other as equals
Peaceful coexistence
To build trust as the core
Use dialogue and cooperation as a means
Forum 21 parties gather together
Not to deal with a common threat
But to achieve a common goal
To maintain regional peace and stability
This is where the common interests of our countries lie
to this end
We should abandon the Cold War mentality
Focus on this common goal
According to the reality and characteristics of the Asia-Pacific region
Adhere to respect for sovereignty in the activities of the forum
Principle of non-interference in internal affairs
Beyond the difference
Expand consensus
Increase trust
Taking into account the safety concerns of all parties
Past year
The activities of the inter-session working groups of the forum are fruitful
Confidence-building measures dialogue is more candid
Further deepening of cooperation in some specific areas
Facts proved
Due to the diversity of the region and the different security experience in history
Increase understanding and trust
Eliminating doubts and anxiety should be the central task of the forum for quite some time
Effective confidence-building measures help countries in the region maintain good relations and maintain regional peace and stability
It is also the basis for security cooperation
There is a lot of work to be done in this area
The potential is far from being developed
Looking back on more than three years of exploration and practice
It is not difficult for us to find
The forum has initially formed a unique way of cooperation
In summary: equal participation
Seek common ground while reserving differences
Consensus
Step by step
These four points are effective
And got the approval of all parties
we believe
Just stick to this
ASEAN Regional Forum Method
The forum will follow the development of the situation in the Asia-Pacific region and the strengthening of mutual trust among countries
Gradually expand the scope of activities
Play a greater role in promoting regional peace and stability
Mr.president
When mankind is about to enter the 21st century
A common concern among countries in the region is how to maintain lasting peace and security in the region
In the new international situation
There should be a new security concept
Security cannot depend on increasing armaments
Can't rely on military alliance
Security should rely on mutual trust and connections of common interests
Mankind has experienced two world wars in the 20th century and the Cold War that lasted for more than 40 years
Paid a heavy price
To avoid repeating the mistakes of history
We believe that there are four important aspects to strengthening regional security:
———Equality between countries
friendly
A stable relationship is an important political foundation for regional peace and stability
Mutual respect and equality
Do not engage in power politics and impose on others
Need dialogue and cooperation
No confrontation and conflict
———Sustained economic development of various countries
Economic exchanges and cooperation continue to expand
So as to deepen the interdependence of the interests of countries
Provide a solid economic foundation for regional security
———Resolve disputes through peaceful means
Is the correct way to maintain regional peace and stability
— Dialogue and cooperation are the main pillars of promoting regional peace and development
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
The ASEAN Regional Forum and others represent multilateral efforts characterized by dialogue and cooperation
In short
We should strengthen our efforts in the above areas
Together to build a lasting peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific
We should work together to cultivate a new concept of regional security that suits the diverse characteristics of the region
Mr.president
As a member of the Asia-Pacific and a permanent member of the Security Council
China attaches great importance to maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region
And made his own contribution to this:
China's own stability and prosperity is a strong support for regional peace and prosperity
China pursues an independent foreign policy of peace
Non-aligned
Not confrontation
Good neighborliness and friendship with Asia-Pacific countries
Get along
China has always advocated peaceful settlement of disputes between countries
Conducted friendly and frank dialogues and consultations with relevant countries

Solve the problem
The settlement of the Hong Kong issue by China and Britain through negotiations is an example of this.
The Macau issue between China and Portugal will also be resolved in 1999
We and relevant countries in the region according to their needs and specific conditions
Carry out bilateral and subregional confidence-building measures
Not long ago
The five countries of China, Russia and Hajita signed the Agreement on Disarmament in the Border Area
This is after the five countries signed the Agreement on Confidence-Building Measures in the Military Field in the Border Area last year.
Strengthen mutual political trust
Another major step to promote regional peace and stability
China actively participates in regional security dialogue and cooperation
Pay attention and support to the establishment and development of the ASEAN Regional Forum
Played its own influence and role
Support ASEAN to play a major role in the forum

It gives me the opportunity to gather together new and old friends who are always enthusiastic about the cause of Sino-Japanese friendship
Feel extra happy

And in my own name
I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all my friends for your kindness and kindness
This year marks the 25th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Japan
Next year is the 20th anniversary of the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship
25 years ago
The leaders of the two countries are farsighted
Make wise political decisions
Normalize diplomatic relations
Opened a new chapter in Sino-Japanese relations
After 25 years of hard work by the governments and peoples of the two countries
The relations between China and Japan and the exchanges and cooperation between the two sides in various fields have made great progress
This not only benefits China and Japan a lot
Also contributed to the peace and development of the Asia-Pacific region and the world
China-Japan relations have developed to this day
Condensed with the hard work and efforts of several generations of the two countries, including my friends
Hard to come by
The people of China and Japan are familiar with
Drinking water never forgets the digger
This old saying
Let us always remember those pioneers who normalized Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations
And people from all walks of life who have worked tirelessly to maintain and develop friendly relations between China and Japan over the years
I would like to take this opportunity
On behalf of the Chinese government and people
Pay high respects to all Japan-China friendship groups and friends
China and Japan are neighbors separated by a strip of water
Are important countries in Asia and the world
Profound changes in the current international situation
With the accelerated development of multi-polarization
Establish and develop long-term and stable good-neighborly and friendly cooperative relations
Not only in the fundamental interests of the people of China and Japan
And it is conducive to the peace and development of the Asia-Pacific region and the world
China and Japan should be based on the current situation
Looking to the future
From a long-term strategic perspective facing the 21st century
Examine and handle the relations between the two countries
Grasp the development direction of Sino-Japanese relations
I think
The basic principles guiding Sino-Japanese relations should be:
---mutual respect
Non-interference in each other's internal affairs
Respect the development path chosen by the other party based on its own national conditions
Beyond the social system
Differences in ideology and values
Get along with each other on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence
Rapprochement
———Seeking common ground while reserving differences
Handling differences properly
Strictly follow the principles of the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship
Eliminate interference
Through peaceful negotiation
Properly handle current and future problems and differences between the two countries
Maintain the overall situation of bilateral relations
Differences and differences between each other should not be an obstacle to the development of bilateral relations
———Strengthen the dialogue
Enhance mutual understanding
Strengthen dialogue and exchanges at all levels and in all fields
Communicate promptly on issues of common concern
Exchange opinions
Increase trust
Expand consensus
---mutually beneficial
Develop economic cooperation
Take a long-term view
Continuously expand the economic and trade cooperation between the two countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit
Learn from each other
Complementary advantages
Further improve the level of cooperation
Achieve common development
---face to the future
Achieve generation-friendliness
On the one hand, we must inherit and carry forward the tradition of friendly cooperation between the two countries
Simultaneously
To educate and guide the younger generation with a correct view of history
Let China-Japan friendship be passed on from generation to generation
friends
just now
We are at an important historical moment at the turn of the century
—
The human society has experienced unforgettable years in the 20th century
There have been two world wars
Bring huge trauma and misfortune to mankind
After the war
Local wars and regional conflicts in the world continue
There was also a cold war that lasted more than 40 years
The people of the world have paid a heavy price for fighting for and defending peace
The good news is
Decades after the war
In general
Countries around the world have made great achievements in economic development and social progress
just now
The cold war is over
But the world is still restless
Unreasonable international political and economic order still exists
North-South relations have not improved
Most countries are still underdeveloped
The people there are still far from poverty and backwardness
therefore
Peace and development are not only the themes of today’s world
It is also a major issue facing human society in the 21st century
China is the largest developing country
Japan is an economically developed country
China and Japan need to strengthen coordination and cooperation in regional and international affairs
Make due contributions to maintaining and promoting peace and development in the region and the world
Japan chose the path of peaceful development after the war
Financial success
Improved international status
This is a good thing for Japan and the world.
We hope that the Japanese government and people can eliminate interference
Continue on the path of peace
Only in this way
Japan can win understanding and respect in the world
Play a more active role in international affairs
Make greater contributions to world peace and development
friends
China is committed to socialist modernization
The most important historical contribution of the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China that was successfully held not long ago is
A comprehensive summary of my country’s experience in reform, opening up and modernization in the past 20 years
Establish Deng Xiaoping Theory as our guide for action
Elect a new central leadership group with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core
Drew a blueprint for China's future development
our target is
Strive to achieve basic modernization by the middle of the next century
This requires a long-term peaceful international environment
Especially good surrounding environment
China is an important force for maintaining world peace
China's development will not pose a threat to any country
Even if China develops in the future
Never dominate
China pursues an independent foreign policy of peace
Attach importance to developing good-neighborly and friendly relations with neighboring countries
It is China’s consistent policy to establish and develop long-term and stable friendly and cooperative relations with Japan.
I firmly believe
China and Japan develop long-term and stable good-neighborly, friendly and cooperative relations
Not only for the benefit of the two peoples
It will also make positive contributions to the cause of world peace and human progress
Thank you all

18 years
He played a role in determining and guiding the development direction of contemporary Chinese history
Mr. Deng is the designer of China’s significant economic reforms
This will undoubtedly establish his historical position as one of the greatest leaders of the 20th century
He took the lead in carrying out economic reforms - and at that time this approach was easy to cause attacks and suspicions in China
Show his extraordinary courage
Mr. Deng’s foresight enabled him to foresee a shift in the balance of global economic and political power that would benefit China one day in the future.
This has become a reality and has indeed changed the international landscape in the past decade
On behalf of the 34 member states of the Organization of American States
Once again express our deep condolences to the Chinese people and sincerely wish peace in your country

It is understood
If you convert the gift you received into money
Just enough for a treat
The villagers call it "coming in the pulp and going in the water"
Most happy hosts usually lose part of the money
Because biscuits are not valuable
The money spent on wine and food for the host’s treats has already greatly exceeded the value of the gifts received

Smoke more

Thoughts on Open Village Government Affairs
(Information at the grassroots level)
Last November 22
A leading comrade from Hebei Province went to Gucheng County for investigation
Visited Zhengkou on the spot
After the government affairs disclosure work in the two towns of Raoyangdian
Although it’s not a long time for Gucheng County to open government affairs
But it works well
Clear thoughts open
Comprehensive content
Formal specification
Not long ago
Gucheng County
The village government affairs disclosure situation was interviewed
In recent years
Due to the unfairness of a few cadres
Financial ambiguity
Farmers’ petitions triggered by power for personal gain are increasing year by year
Gucheng County Party Committee
The county government did everything possible to solve it
The result is always pressing the gourd and lifting it
Last March
Hebei Provincial Party Committee proposed to implement
Fish water project
Push administrative affairs open
The leaders of the county party committee think this is a solution to many problems in the countryside
To start farmers
Golden key
Not only to catch
And must work hard to achieve results
Determined to make big measures hard
April 10, 1996
The enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the County Party Committee studied and formulated the "Implementation Plan of the Gucheng County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China on Strengthening Township (Town) and Village Government Affairs"
The county party secretary is determined to be responsible
Led by the County Commission for Discipline Inspection
Establish a leading group for the open government affairs of the county party committee
Transferred competent cadres from 10 related departments to form an office
13 towns
All 538 administrative villages have established corresponding open government organizations
28 county-level officials include 13 townships
15 bureau chiefs eat and live in township offices
One bag to the end
And open positions for government affairs at the rural two levels
Public content
Open procedure
File management and villager supervision
Make a full deployment
Make specific requests
Subsequently
The main responsible comrades of the county party committee went to the countryside for inspection
Found that there are two hot spots for open government affairs
Cool in the middle
Some village officials said
Today’s rural cadres are not good enough
It's not a urge to purchase food all year round
It’s the retention, retention, family planning, etc.
The net is to offend people
The thorny heads can’t hold the handle
But handed the knife to others
How to work in rural areas
to this end
The leading comrades of the county party committee strengthen ideological education on the one hand
At the same time, decided to take strong administrative intervention measures
Township
Village government affairs open
In the country
At the village cadre meeting
The leading comrades of the county party committee announced on the spot: Those who are open to government affairs or are passively sabotaged
No matter who
Handle strictly
The county party committee and the township party committee secretary signed a letter of responsibility
The township party committee signs a letter of responsibility with the village party secretary
Grasp the first level: where the township is not implemented according to the regulations of the county party committee
Village government affairs open
secretary
Township head demoted
Village Party Secretary
Removal of village director
County Government Affairs Open Office inspects and accepts village by village
Adjustments were made to all 26 village officials who did not disclose or falsely disclose government affairs
Two-way supervision consciously implemented
To ensure the satisfaction of the masses
Prevent public content from being fake
Muddle through
The County Commission for Discipline Inspection issued the "Working Measures for the Villager Supervision Group"
Directly sent to the leader of the open government supervision group elected by all villagers
Give the villager supervision team five swords of Shang Fang:
One is to the village branch
Village committee's daily work supervision power
The second is the right to review various public content prepared by the village committees
Cannot be published on the wall without review
The third is the right to supervise and correct false public content
The fourth is the right to suggest solutions to problems raised by villagers
Fifth, the right to report the problem to the township disciplinary committee and the county committee
The County Party Committee’s Government Affairs Open Office
Village government affairs disclosure content is true
specific
Facilitate two-way supervision
Uniformly printed
One gear, seven meters and four cards
11 forms
Including "financial income and expenditure schedule"
"Electricity Rate to Household Table"
"Order and Withdrawal to Account Form"
"Family planning and marital status table"
"Contract Form for Various Industries"
"Homestead Distribution Status Table"
"Cadre Responsibility Target Table" and "Electricity Rate and Electricity Price Information Card"
"Description Card for Ordering, Withdrawing and Retaining Overall Planning"
"Other Issues Concerned by the Masses"
"Government Affairs Disclosure Conclusion Report Card"
Township archives in duplicate
Village-level files in triplicate
Report to the village before the 8th of each month
Report to the County Public Office together with the township archives 10 days ago
Simultaneously
It is clearly stipulated that public files must be signed by all members of the villager supervision team before they can be reported level by level
Issues in the openness of government affairs
Take strong supervision measures at any time
Implement regular joint inspections
Deploy every job
Then organize the county-wide joint investigation
Village inspection and scoring
Queuing from town to town
Recorded in the cadre target management file
Village tents, township management, rest assured
In the practice of publicizing administrative affairs
Finance is the top priority of public content
Is a hot spot of public concern
Is the focal point that affects the relationship between cadres and groups
Some village cadres come on every public day
A handful of slivers in left hand
A handful of money in the right hand
A bunch of bad debts
Submit to the supervision team for review
It turned out that money that shouldn't be spent was spent
Can only be investigated and handled
Cadre punished
Farmers bear the loss
How can we prevent trouble before it happens
Completely change the chaotic situation of rural financial management
Gucheng County began to implement in 1994
Village account
Democratic financial management
Economic audit
This new financial management system
Run for more than a year
good results
But since the township was expanded
Some townships failed to persist
Some villages with developed collective economy
There are three fears of village account management: one is afraid of revealing wealth
Fear of having no right to spend
Three fears of misappropriation
To recover quickly throughout the county
Improve the village account and township management system
County party committee
The county government has determined the four non-principles of village account management: the ownership of the village’s funds remains unchanged
The principal and interest all go to the village
The township government does not borrow
Not embezzle
Do not delay use in the village
These measures are publicly introduced
Dispel the ideological doubts of the cadres and the masses
Villagers’ financial management team represents the villagers’ wishes
Implement democratic decision-making on the village's finances
Management and supervision
Approval of the budget and extra-budgetary expenditures at the beginning of the year
And report financial management to the villagers’ representative committee
The agricultural economic station achieves the unified management of the village account and township:
Unified funds are turned over to the account (only Zhengkou Town Agricultural Economic Station has 10.41 million yuan in the escrow village by the end of September)
Unified access
Approval documents
Unified printing of accounts
Unified management of accounts
Unified training accounting
Unified station office
Audit bill entry
Unified reporting of the income and expenditure details of each village
Facilitate monitoring by township leaders
Unified Management Accounting
Village accountants enjoy the same treatment as main village cadres
Wages are paid by the Agricultural Economic Station
Not approved by the Agricultural Economic Station
The village committee has no right to replace the accountant
Since the new village account and township management mechanism was put into operation
Zhengkou Town alone will return the collective debt of more than 800,000 yuan
Veto 298 items of non-productive expenditure
10.5 million yuan in savings
The county rejected more than 2,000 unreasonable expenditures during the review
Up to 10 million yuan

Talking from participating in voluntary labor
Jin Yongbo, Suihua City, Heilongjiang
According to the report: every major construction project in Tianjin
All cadres and masses in the city must be organized to participate in voluntary labor
This has been going on for years
Only when the outer ring road was repaired in 1995
Hundreds of thousands of people participate in voluntary labor
Not only greatly advance the construction period
And save a lot of money
Cadres and the masses of Tianjin participate in voluntary labor
And persevere
How rare is this
It not only contributed to the construction of socialist material civilization
And contributed to the construction of spiritual civilization
Revolutionary teacher Lenin
Voluntary labor
Gave a very high evaluation
He pointed out in the article "The Great Pioneering Work":
Communist stuff
It only started when it was voluntary labor on Saturday
Voluntary labor
Is a cell of the new socialist society
Is an extremely important aspect of communism construction
just now
We are building socialism with Chinese characteristics
The ultimate goal is to realize communism
To realize communism
Not only need to build a high degree of material civilization
And need to build a high level of spiritual civilization
As pointed out in the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee:
Material civilization is the foundation
The center of economic construction must be firmly grasped
Unwavering
But spiritual civilization can't
Material civilization will also be destroyed
Even society will deteriorate
and so
Material civilization
Both spiritual civilization are of great significance
Voluntary labor
We must not only strongly advocate
And all relevant parties must take measures to implement and stick to it
Careful analysis is not difficult to see
In recent years, the phenomenon of money worship has emerged in society
There are many reasons for this
But mainly because some people lack socialist and communist ideas in their heads
One-sided understanding of building socialism with Chinese characteristics
therefore
The resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee
To promote socialism in the whole society
Communist morality
Continuously improve the ideological and moral standards of the whole nation
From this aspect also shows
Deepening reform
Open wider
Under the new situation of developing socialist market economy
Cadres and the masses of Tianjin participate in voluntary labor
Has its special political significance and era significance
Building a high degree of socialism
Two civilizations
Needs a little spirit
This
point
spirit
For the country
For the collective
Dedication to society
Cadres and the masses of Tianjin participate in voluntary labor
It is the concentrated expression of this spirit
of course
We promote socialism in the whole society
Communist morality
Not to deny the principle of material benefits
But to combine the advanced nature with the requirements of broadness
Encourage and support all ideological and moral conducive to the liberation and development of socialist productive forces
Everything is conducive to the pursuit of truth, goodness and beauty
Resist fake evil
Promote the morality of righteousness
Everything is conducive to the fulfillment of civil rights and obligations
The ideology and morality of striving for a better life with honest labor
As a communist
A national official
An enlightened citizen of the Republic
Should never be satisfied only with material interests
But should have a working attitude to contribute to the cause of socialism
Do a new era
Cutest person
Zhao Beibei
I stared at this group of photos for a long time
What attracts me is not just the protagonist in the photo—young volunteers from the prosperous cities of the motherland who went to the desolate mountainous area of ​​northwest Shanxi to help the poor
And the mountain people who gathered around them
I paid special attention to the expressions of these people who grow in the gullies on the loess slopes
I didn’t find the confusion of the mountain people I remember
Sluggish eyes
What catches my eyes are vivid faces
Looking at the trust of the women around Dr. Chen Qi
Looking at the bright smiles of the children around Shen Lei
Looking at the focused expression of the young man who learned pruning techniques from Sun Guorong
Watching the joyous crowd that surrounds Luya
Look at the dilapidated but English blackboard behind Ji Chengbing
Wang Zhirong leads the rugged path that the mountain baby walks and the figure of Cai Chunlong who is active in the stadium
A kind of respect comes from the bottom of my heart
I am convinced
These young or not too young volunteers brought to poor mountainous areas
More than just knowledge and joy
More angry and hopeful
As a reporter who interviewed young volunteers active in the city a few years ago
I know
This group of photos
It can be said to be the epitome of today's young volunteers in China
volunteer
It is a title that has only become familiar to the Chinese people in recent years
but
volunteer
This word is no stranger to middle-aged people
Early liberation
To defend the country
Millions of Chinese People's Volunteers do not hesitate to throw their heads
Shed blood
Stepped into the ranks of Resisting U.S. Aid Korea
Become the song and tear of that era
Cutest person
Nearly half a century has passed
Earth-shaking changes have taken place in China today
Compatriots, who account for nearly a quarter of the world’s population, thrive on this land
China, which is becoming rich and powerful, must face today
Quite a few areas have not yet shaken off poverty and backwardness
The places where food and clothing have been solved still need to be improved and developed
In other words
Survival and development are still major issues facing the Chinese who will enter the next century
At such a new historical juncture
Batches without fame and fortune
Volunteers who don't want to pay appear in the most needed places in the motherland
Sowing the seeds of hope with my sincere heart and hard work
Acting as a messenger of civilization
Really gratifying
Awe-inspiring
They deserve to be the new era
Cutest person
People have their own ambitions
The cuteness of these young volunteers lies in their ambition to take the world as their own responsibility and their willingness and down-to-earth commitment to benefit others.
Deeds of business that benefit society
In today's increasingly developed commodity society
They are not confined to their own selfishness
Integrate one's life into a wider world
To live to the fullest
A dignified group
A philosopher said:
Human dignity lies in the ability to repay
The degree of a person's life is directly proportional to the degree of care for others
If one’s survival can bring benefits to others and society
He is a lovely person
A respectable person
Responsible to myself but also to society
This is the spirit of the times we need
Be a society
cute person
When more
It can become a lovely society that is the ideal society we yearn for and pursue
The realization of an ideal society depends on the unremitting efforts of generations.
Depends on everyone
Start from me
Aspirants
It happened
Let us use this sentence to encourage the volunteers
Infinite mourning sends a long sky oath to make a grand plan
Party Group of China Aviation Industry Corporation
Comrade Deng Xiaoping, beloved by the whole party, army and people of all ethnic groups in the country, passed away
Caused great grief among the employees of the aviation industry
The third-tier area from the coast of Heilongjiang to Yunguichuan
From Shaanxi-Gansu Revolutionary Old Area to Coastal Special Economic Zone
560,000 employees deeply cherish his care and support for the aviation industry
Infinite grief is beyond words
Every achievement made by my country's aviation industry
They all contain the magnificent courage and outstanding wisdom of this great proletarian revolutionary
Condensed his infinite affection and great expectations for the motherland’s aviation industry
my country's aviation industry was established and developed with the great attention of the party and the country
Comrade Xiaoping, as an important member of the party's first-generation leadership group and the core of the second-generation leadership group
Participated in a series of major decisions for the creation and development of the aviation industry
December 5, 1955
Comrade Xiaoping inspected Shenyang Aircraft Factory
Watch after the first flight of my country’s first fighter jet
Happy to say:
In order to build a strong People’s Air Force
We have to have our own aviation industry
And a modern aviation industry
After Comrade Xiaoping presided over the work of the Central Committee in 1974
Repeatedly emphasized the important position and role of the aviation industry
When listening to a report by Comrade Lu Dong, Minister of the Third Ministry of Machinery Industry (Aviation Industry), he said:
I tend to focus investment on the aviation industry and the development of the air force
To obtain air supremacy
After that he emphasized again
If we can have a certain number of more advanced aircraft
The situation in our country is different
to this end
He repeatedly asked the aviation industry to establish a leadership team that dared to take the lead
Grasp the development of key factories
He was very angry when he heard the dictatorship of bad guys in some key aviation companies
Request immediate resolution
On key funding issues
He pointed out:
Money is not a problem
The key is whether you can do it
When our country’s finances are very poor,
He personally made a series of major decisions on the development of new aviation equipment
Strongly promote the development of the aviation industry
Since 1978
The aviation industry establishes a new generation
Develop a generation
The task of the pre-research generation
Basically completed by 1988
After that
The new generation of the party’s leadership collective has made some major decisions one after another.
Maintain the momentum of sustained development of the aviation industry
Practice proved
Without the attention and support of the party and the country
It is difficult for the aviation industry to develop so fast
The contemporary aviation industry is a high-tech industry with high investment and high-level decision-making
Technological development plays a decisive role
Comrade Xiaoping has a deep insight into this trend
Special attention is paid to aviation technology
In 1978, he clearly stated:
Research is huge productivity
This is particularly evident in the aviation industry
In 1979, when he heard the report from the responsible comrades of the Three Machines Department, he emphasized again:
Strengthen scientific research
This is the general trend
Not only the aviation industry
Not engage in scientific research
We simply cannot have modernization
From October 1977 to October 1981
Comrade Xiaoping successively gave a series of important instructions to aviation science and technology work
Including the development of aviation research and development, we need to take steps step by step
Science and technology work must concentrate forces to fight annihilation wars, etc.
To accelerate the development of aviation technology
He also raised the issue of introducing new technologies from abroad and cultivating talents.
In 1978, he told the person in charge of the Third Machinery Department
And abroad
Technical cooperation is a new form
I advocate opening this door
Especially the introduction of the lack of technology
In response to the shortage of aviation technology talents at that time
He said anxiously
You haven’t started training technical cadres yet
Skilled workers are too late
Aviation Academy is also a scientific research institution
Enrollment needs to double
And proposed to select a part of the 3,000 people who have been good in the math competition to enrich the aviation industry
Request to vigorously run 3 aviation academies
Quickly prepare for the establishment of a new aviation school
According to a series of instructions from Comrade Xiaoping and the spirit of the National Science Conference
The aviation industry proposes and earnestly implements scientific research first
Policy of strengthening pre-research and speeding up aircraft renewal
The rapid development of aviation technology
A number of important scientific research results have been achieved
Simultaneously
by
Spey
Introduction of engines and other items
Mastered a batch of foreign advanced technology
The training of aviation technology talents has been significantly strengthened
All this indicates that the aviation industry has embarked on a path of healthy development
In Comrade Deng Xiaoping’s theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics
Have a very visionary mind
Is to reform and adjust the military industry system
Implement the policy of military-civilian integration
As early as 1975
When he listened to the report from the defense industry, he analyzed:
Some factories have reached a certain level
Non-conversion civilian products can’t survive
This problem will be very prominent in 5 years
In 1978 he formally proposed:
Military industry wants to find the way
Military industry must reserve
Production capacity shifted to civilian use
By 1982 he said again:
Four sentences in the defense industry
Military-civilian integration
Combination of peace and war
Mainly military
Raise the army by the people
among them
Change from military priority to military product priority
The other three sentences remain unchanged
In order to promote the strategic transformation of military enterprises
He raised the issue of military industry system reform
June 1986
When Mo Wenxiang, Minister of Aviation Industry, reported to Comrade Xiaoping that some problems were encountered in the transfer of military to civilians
Xiaoping said:
Our military system is still the same as that of the Soviet Union
The Soviet system proved to be a loss
Mainly it cannot drive the civil industry
Cannot drive the entire economy
therefore
my country's military industry system needs to be reformed
Otherwise, you will suffer
And ask Comrade Mo Wenxiang to convey this opinion to other central leaders
The central government made a decision soon
Put the military industry departments under the direct leadership of the State Council
Ever since
The aviation industry began to step out of the small world of military industry
Entered the battlefield of national economic construction
In the transition from military to civilian
Comrade Xiaoping is very concerned about the development of domestic civil aircraft
As early as 1978
In view of the requirements of some industries to introduce civilian aircraft for census
He instructed:
You can no longer buy aircraft that are already in the country
In early 1979 he asked
The Three Ministry of Machines and the Civilian
We must work hard to build military aircraft
Also build civil aircraft
Produce civil aircraft
You can buy airplanes with less foreign exchange
Civil aircraft can be operated jointly with other countries
Military aircraft can be operated by joint stock
After we do it out, we can still export to third world countries
In 1981, he pointed out at the enlarged meeting of the Politburo:
The use of domestically-made civilian aircraft on domestic routes must be determined as a national policy
at the same time
Comrade Xiaoping is also very concerned about the opening up of the aviation industry
In 1978 he said:
The aviation industry must truly be solvent
We need to export transport aircraft
Later on:
Military aid issues need to be studied
It doesn’t work if you don’t be an arms dealer
Military products to be exported
To give the ministries more autonomy
Including import and export companies
Promote decentralization
Not only the Ministry of Machinery
Every department should be like this
And personally gave instructions for some aircraft export projects in the aviation industry
Comrade Xiaoping’s series of far-sighted thoughts
Pointing out the direction for the reform and opening up of the aviation industry
After more than ten years of hard work
The aviation industry has developed and produced a number of pillar civilian products
The output value of civilian products is increasing at a rate of 25% per year
The rapid development of civil aircraft

Yun 8
Yun 12 series aircraft are widely used in national economic construction
Co-produced MD82 trunk line aircraft with the United States
The further cooperation MD90-30 trunkline aircraft has been put into production
Yoya
The AE100 medium-sized passenger aircraft jointly developed by European countries has started
In the history of the aviation industry
There have been several big setbacks
Great Leap Forward
Years
The aviation industry failed to deliver aircraft to the army for three years due to serious quality problems
Ten years of turmoil
Made the aviation industry
Hardest hit area
In 1971, thousands of aircraft could not be delivered due to quality problems
This attracted the attention of Comrade Xiaoping
In 1974, he requested that the quality of the aviation industry be regarded as a breakthrough in the rectification of the defense industry.
Emphasize the defense industry
Still have to talk about quality first
Especially the air force
Later, he proposed to use the CCP Central Committee Document No. 1759 to rectify railways to solve the problems of the aviation industry.
In 1978, while listening to Comrade Lu Dong’s report, he said:
The quality of the aircraft is 100%
Ninety-nine-nine percent is not good
This requires a series of specific measures
Under the guidance of Comrade Xiaoping's series of instructions
The quality work of the aviation industry has developed rapidly from restorative rectification to constructive rectification
Start to implement total quality management
A batch of key new machines have achieved high-quality development and production
Yuanyuan delivered troops and other users
A total of 4 types of aircraft have won the National Science and Technology Progress Special Prize and the First Prize respectively
Two aircraft won the National Quality Gold Award
A large number of non-aeronautical products have also entered various fields of national economic development with high quality
Dear and beloved Comrade Xiaoping, although he is away from us
But his great care for the aviation industry
Deep expectations
Always inspire the fighting spirit and actions of the employees of the aviation industry
We must inherit Comrade Xiaoping's legacy
Fully understand the strategic position and role of the aviation industry
Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core
Realize the take-off of China's aviation industry as soon as possible

Wei Jin
As a journalist
A few years ago, I was always a little confused about participating in the "two sessions"
Because the representative
When members make comments
The news media is often the object of criticism
It’s not that there’s a problem with the political orientation of a report
It is one-sided propaganda on an economic issue
More is "one hand hard
Soft-handed
Ignore the propaganda of socialist spiritual civilization
and many more
under these circumstances
My mood is conflicted
On the one hand, these opinions are reasonable
On the other hand, I feel that the "board" can't all be hit on the news unit
In short
Existing pressure
Wronged again
Last few years
The situation has changed
Criticism of the news media is gradually decreasing
More and more good things for news organizations
Especially during the "Two Sessions" this year
representative
Committee members are reviewing national politics in the past year
economic
society
The gratifying situation in culture and diplomacy
The role played by the news media is often mentioned
Thank the journalists for their efforts
This meeting
CPPCC member Li Feng was talking about macro-control over the past year
Life improvement
Fight hard
Anti pornography
Beyond the "five satisfactions" of diplomatic work
Emphasizes the satisfaction with the construction of socialist spiritual civilization
He said emotionally
Change
Soft-handed
Have a credit for the press
As a journalist
Heard such affirmation
Feel relieved
Warm
But it is not
News is a reflection of facts
Progress in news and publicity work
The first is based on objective facts
For a year
Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core
People of all ethnic groups across the country struggle in unity
Proactive
Whether it is the construction of socialist material civilization
Or socialist spiritual civilization construction
Have made brilliant achievements
A good start for the realization of the grand cross-century program
With this universally recognized objective reality
To make news reports authentic and reliable
Colorful
Convincing
Encouraging content
otherwise
Journalists have a brilliant pen
What's the benefit
Have the basis of objective facts
There is also a question of how to correctly reflect
This requires correct guiding ideology and propaganda policy
Comrade Jiang Zemin inspected the People’s Daily last year
An important speech by the People's Liberation Army Daily
Pointed out the direction for the majority of journalists
So that everyone is greatly encouraged and encouraged
Reports on advanced models of spiritual civilization in the past year
Climax
Played a major role in real life
It is the news team that further unifies the thinking under the leadership of the Party Central Committee
Form synergy
The result of coordinated operations
This magnificent
A deeply rooted situation
It is by no means possible to emerge from the efforts of one or two news units or a few individuals
therefore
Facing the representatives of the "two sessions"
Committee members' affirmation of journalism
We must be gratified

Treasure this hard-won social evaluation a hundred times
Work harder to study Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics
Work harder and go deep into reality
Reach the masses
Work harder to improve the quality of publicity
Bring out more news items worthy of the great era

Now it’s for cadres to learn theory
Businessmen want to learn economics
Workers have to learn skills...
Eliminate various utilitarian purposes
It is more and more people who consciously or unconsciously realize that they should bring more knowledge and culture to tomorrow
Towards the new century
The Chinese nation in reform and opening up is moving toward a higher civilization

Environmental protection and health: new theme of clothing culture (1 picture attached)
Fu Yong
Eco-friendly fashion known as "green" fashion is popular internationally
Its performance is
People inject environmental awareness into clothing
And show it in fashion
Such as cotton clothes using colored cotton as raw material
No need for printing and dyeing
Shrink mechanically
To avoid the use of chemical resins
zipper
Pins, etc. are made of stainless alloy
No electroplating
To avoid using a lot of harmful substances
Buttons are also made of glass or wood
Eco-friendly fashion also advocates the recycling of waste
Such as using discarded denim as raw materials
Mashed into fibrous
Comb again
Woven into new denim
Saves resources
Reduced pollution again
Last fall
Beijing Exhibition of "21st Century Fashion Design Competition" held in Beijing
Bring to China the world's popular wind that ordinary people can't feel on a daily basis
The shapes of the works are different
Styles present a variety of styles
Highlight the national characteristics and practicality of various regions of the world
At the same time, it shows the theme of the next century's clothing: consider environmental protection requirements and ensure health and safety
Dress is not only to beautify
And be scientific
Traditional clothing design talks about three elements: fabrics
color
Style
Science and technology are changing with each passing day
Industrial production development
Not only promotes social progress
Improve people's quality of life
It also brings ecological imbalance
Negative effects of environmental pollution
This negative effect is reflected in clothing
Especially developed countries have been quite prominent
According to the market research report of the United Nations International Trade Center: "Europe’s requirements for clothing quality are changing rapidly.
Mainly reflected in the health and safety regulations and environmental protection signs of clothing
』
The European Market Conference recently passed the "Red Book on Rejection of Hazardous Substances"
Germany has enacted regulations to control 20 kinds of azo dyes containing harmful amines since April 1, 1996
No production and import
Textile garments containing such dyes shall not be sold on the market from October 1, 1996
It is said that
Some Germans love pure cotton fabrics
But it is necessary to ask whether organic fertilizer or inorganic fertilizer is used to grow cotton
EU adopts "ce" logo for safety and health
United States
Japan and other countries have developed a variety of "green" textiles and garments into the market
Japan implemented the "pl" law on July 1, 1995
Provision for garments that contain foreign matter
Skin allergies and injuries caused by pollution
To be held accountable
To justice
In my country
People's clothing consumption accounts for an increasing proportion of living expenses
Not only "Spend money for beauty"
And there is a trend of "spending money for health"
my country's clothing exports
Slowed down since 1996
In addition to international economic conditions
The quality of clothing safety and environmental protection is also an urgent issue
There is a considerable part of clothing residual pollution
Obstructed by not meeting the environmental protection requirements of the importing country
The export volume of silk garments decreased due to the problem of azo dyes
tomorrow
What we wear
It is a new fashion pursued by everyone who wants to live a better life

Inspiration from a parent meeting
Wu Jincai
Participated in a parent meeting not long ago
Listening to the principal telling something quite enlightening at the meeting
The TV station came to school to learn about students reading extracurricular books
Two answers are unexpected:
One is that the pupils are not as legendary
Complaining that there is no healthy book to read
second
Elementary school students don’t like to read Japanese cartoon books
Think those things are messy
What to see
This survey asked more students
I was surprised after listening
Because for a long time
I always hear worried people screaming
Children have no suitable things to read
of course
Almost all these things are being said by adults
What do children think for themselves
But not many adults investigate it carefully
The complaints about children's books have been the strongest in recent years
It was just a few years when my son grew up from kindergarten to elementary school
Father of man now
Not only to make my son full
And let my son have good books
Have a good show
Of course I have to care about this market
Of course, go to the children's book counter in the bookstore often
Almost every time
That kind of complaining doesn't seem to be all
Children's books make money
This truth
Everyone in the book industry knows
therefore
Almost all bookstores sell children's books in large stores
In my opinion
There are many popular Chinese and foreign masterpieces for children
There are many comics created in China
Popular traditional books in the 1950s and 1960s that our parents have read
Also a lot
Why there are so many kinds of these books
One sentence
It is the competitive environment that brings abundance and prosperity
The competitive environment has a big feature
Is to do everything possible to adapt to the needs of the people
What people care about children's books
One is a child
The second is the parents
The publisher wants to make this money
You must correctly assess the parents’ book selection level
Correctly assess children’s interest in reading
Judge the big picture
Mainly to judge the level of civilization of the parents
Nowadays, many parents really find Japanese cartoon books interesting
Do you think foreign books are better than Chinese books
Not really
According to this judgment
I think the publisher’s estimate of children’s books is basically accurate
At least a parent like me
Never felt anything in this respect
Food shortage
Every time you visit the children's bookcase
I sincerely lament that I was there when I was young
Cultural Revolution
Those years
What serious books have you read
That's the real
Food shortage
Incidentally,
Publications in the age of competition
Can't ignore market factors
therefore
Go to the market before drawing conclusions
And chat with the small vendors
It seems necessary
E.g
Everyone looks at the market trend based on the books on the counter
Actually
Books on the cabinet
Does not necessarily reflect the real megatrend
What books have been placed for a long time
Good selling book
Take a shot in a few days
Coupled with the small capital of our bookstores
Difficult to store books for a long time
Most of the bestsellers disappeared in a short time
such
Only unsold books
Just put it on the counter every day
A small bookstore owner smiled bitterly and said: selling books for several years
In the end, only a pile of books that cannot be sold are left
This can be said to be a talk of experience
Comrades who often visit bookstores
It’s not hard to notice this kind of unsalable book
Continuity
Japanese manga books are in many bookstores every day
Does not necessarily mean that they sell very well
This is the truth
Propaganda and distribution work seminars in some provinces and regions emphasized the distribution of People’s Daily as the top priority
Our newspaper, Beijing, September 4, reporter Yang Yong reported: Some provinces and autonomous regions People’s Daily Propaganda and Distribution Forum will be held in Beijing from September 3 to 4
The meeting thought

Improving the quality of publicity reports is the prerequisite and foundation for the distribution work
He summarized the important results of the propaganda and reports since General Secretary Jiang inspected the People's Daily last year.
Indicates that the quality must be improved
More boutique

Create a good learning environment——An investigation on the rectification of public order in universities in Jiangsu Province
Our reporter Cui Yuewen
(One)
Jiangsu is one of the provinces with developed higher education in my country
Some time ago
The college campus and surrounding environment here are not conducive to teaching
Problems not conducive to stability
Mainly manifested in the following aspects:
One is that some criminals threaten the personal safety of teachers and students and interfere with the normal teaching order
Increase in criminal security cases on campus
Second, the environmental problems surrounding the campus are prominent
restaurant
Song and dance hall
Recreation hall
Video room
Karaoke halls, etc. are opened around the school
Lack of strict management
Some people post unhealthy advertisements on campus
Individuals even put
Pornography
Spread to student dormitories
Adversely affect students' physical and mental health
Third, the commercial stalls on campus are messy
ballroom
Karaoke
Random construction of restaurants, etc.
Some school houses are rented to outsiders
Squeezed out student activities
Fourth, product posters are posted everywhere in schools
Many student dormitories have become trading venues
Miscellaneous people staying overnight are repeatedly prohibited
Disturbed the school's public order
Fifth, the school hires more off-campus workers
Not manage them strictly
Some of them fight in school
Insult girls
There are many reasons for the above problems
mainly:
Recent years
School breaks the relatively closed situation
School for the society
Expand enrollment

And by comparison
Management lag
School security organization is not sound
The cadre team is unstable
Low quality of personnel
Not suitable for work needs
Backward internal prevention technology
School door guard system is not strict
All kinds of casual people flooded into the school
taxi
motorcycle
Bicycle travel freely
Random parking
Shocked the normal school order
A threat to school safety
Teachers and students have great opinions
Unanimous appeal: improve the learning environment on campus
Return a piece of pure land to the school
(two)
Aiming at the increasingly complex surrounding environment of the campus
A situation that keeps causing trouble
Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee

listen to opinions
Put forward rectification requirements
Provincial Social Security Comprehensive Management Committee in conjunction with Provincial Public Security Department

Nanjing Gulou District
The government of the high-tech development zone and the streets cooperate and support each other
Solved the problem of long-term influence on school order in the farmers market around Nanjing Transportation Technical School and Nanjing Mechanical Technical School
It turned out that the various stalls operating outside the Nanjing University school crowded the road
Cleaned up
A new look
Now a green belt has been built outside Nanjing University
(four)
To consolidate the results of comprehensive governance
Universities in Jiangsu Province seize the opportunity of this comprehensive management of social security
Adjustment and enrichment of school security institutions
according to
Who is in charge
Who is responsible
the rules
Implement comprehensive governance responsibility system at all levels
Various departments
Section Sign
Vertical to bottom
Lateral to side
Letter of responsibility
Do it separately
Optimistic about your own door
Someone who manages himself
Do your own thing
Colleges and universities across the province adjusted and enriched the guard force
Improve various systems
Implement strict management
China University of Mining and Technology and Suzhou University also hire full-time security personnel
Strengthen doorman management
Effectively prevent the occurrence of public security incidents
Supervision teams have also been established in various universities
By the students themselves
Popular among college students
Wang Songlin, a student from Soochow University Law School, and Huang Hongfang, a student from the Department of Sociology, said: University campus should be a civilized and standardized place
College students should be models of civility and politeness
Students should develop good moral training and living habits in school
therefore
We should correct ourselves
Self-discipline
Actively participate in social security and school environmental governance activities
The responsible comrade of the Yangzhou Municipal Legal Committee told reporters
Yangzhou University has 10,000 teachers and students
Reorganized last year
There is no public security case in the school so far
Popular science
fight
Phenomenon should not be ignored
With economic development and social progress
People's technological awareness is constantly increasing
Especially in recent years
As people's living standards improve
In pursuit of health
More and more people are paying attention to diet science and medical care
Adapt to this
Many newspapers
magazine
Radio station
TV stations have launched popular science special editions and life science columns
To improve people’s health
Guide life
It played an important role in promoting the popularization and promotion of science and technology
But some mass media are not serious about the promotion of popular science knowledge
Cause popular science articles to mutually
fight
Phenomenon is very prominent
Make readers
The audience is perplexed
At a loss
such as
There are more cancer patients now
So various media have appeared with authority
Introduce all kinds of
Anticancer substances
: Laver
kelp
asparagus
White radish
potato
Chinese cabbage
Dozens of tomatoes, etc.
It seems that various fruits and vegetables related to our lives have anti-cancer effects
To this
Many people are puzzled: we eat anti-cancer food every day
Why are cancer patients not decreasing
In fact, the conclusion that the above foods have anti-cancer effects is not accurate
Such as the claim that seaweed is anti-cancer
From a research institution in Japan
The institution’s doctors pass a group of animal experiments at a time
Just claim
Laver contains anti-cancer ingredients
But the conclusion was announced only a week
Five authoritative medical scientists from Waseda University in Japan pointed out
This statement is very likely
Insufficient basis
Then they passed the same animal experiment
Use data to negate the previous conclusion
And some newspapers published
Middle-aged and elderly people should not eat eggs
Cautionary Article
Said egg yolk contains higher cholesterol
It induces high blood pressure
Coronary heart disease
The culprit of atherosclerosis and stroke
Some older people read this type of article
Dare not eat eggs
In fact, this is also a partial generalization
Scientific research shows
Although eggs contain higher cholesterol
But it also contains a lot of lecithin
After lecithin is absorbed by the gastrointestinal
Can make cholesterol fat particles in the blood smaller
Suspended in the blood to avoid deposits on the blood vessel wall
It also promotes the absorption of cholesterol through the blood vessel wall
Its harm ceases to exist
therefore
Experts advise people from a more scientific perspective: You can eat eggs with confidence
now
Such contradictory popular science articles are not uncommon in the media.
Such as articles about the nutritional value of bird's nest
A newspaper said:
The latest foreign research confirms
The nutritional value of bird's nest is very high
It has obvious and unique tonic effect on human body
But another magazine wrote:
The latest foreign scientific research shows
Bird's nest actually has no nutritional value
Readers don't know who to trust
Science cannot be fake
It is not only the duty of scientists to defend the dignity of science
More needs the joint efforts of the whole society and legal protection
For popular science propaganda
fight
problem
The author suggests that we should start from the following aspects:

Some Thoughts on Carrying out Quality Education
To carry out quality education, the education policy must be fully implemented
For all students
Comprehensively improve students' morality
Cultural science knowledge
Labor skills and physical and psychological quality
Focus on improving students' ideological and moral quality
Improving the quality of classroom teaching
Improve the overall quality of the teaching staff
It is also necessary to establish and gradually improve an effective quality education operating mechanism
Several vague understandings of quality education should be clarified: To overcome the tendency to take exams is not to cancel all exams
However, the forms and methods of examinations need to be improved and perfected under the premise of serving quality education.
Downplaying the competition for further education is not about downplaying the need for further education
Solve the problem that more and more parents want their children to receive higher and better education
Also try to open up schools
Expand the total supply of social education
Gradually lead the competition for higher education to the competition of running a school
Running every school well cannot be simply understood as
Go in step
The gap is objective
However, it is necessary to further increase the support of governments at all levels to poor areas and weak schools
Widely carry out inter-school pairing assistance activities
At the same time, it is necessary to encourage some qualified primary and secondary schools to create advantages in all-round development
Show the model of quality education
Go in step
Does not work in practice
Advocating all-round development should not be one-sidedly interpreted as
Balanced development
Unrealistically require students to excel in every subject
Trying to use a mold to mold students into standard parts for average development
Is a misunderstanding and misunderstanding of all-round development
Promote quality education
Should stick to the theory
Focus on practice
Actually starting from various places
Take a new path of characteristic quality education
To optimize the social environment
Leading cadres at all levels of the party and government must not issue the education administrative department and the school’s entry targets
Not only based on the admission rate and test scores
Reward and Punish Schools and Teachers
Do not use authority to facilitate the choice of school for children's relatives
News media must play a strong guiding role
Make quality education a social consensus
Let more and more parents of students take the initiative to cooperate with the school to reduce the burden on students
Strengthen labor skills education
Develop students' hobbies and personality skills
Culture and other departments should provide sufficient extracurricular activity venues that are conducive to the healthy growth of young people
Strictly prohibit and ban reading materials that are not conducive to the physical and mental development of young people
Audiovisual
Film and event venues
To completely get rid of the concept of talents and teaching in examination-oriented education
Use necessary administrative methods to prohibit wrong practices that violate the laws of education and teaching
Continue to innovate in educational concepts and methods
Educational administration would rather control expenses in other ways
Including less infrastructure projects
We must also ensure sufficient education and research funding
And coordinate the welfare of education and scientific research personnel
So that they can devote themselves to work
At the same time take a series of practical and effective measures
Improve the quality of the education team
These are for quality education

(Huang Xinmao, Zhu Zhenyue, Zhejiang Education Commission)
A lesson on Xiongbiyan
Li Dongdong, National Economic Reform Commission
1994
I went from the "Economic Daily" where I worked for 10 years to Zhangjiajie in northwestern Hunan.
Two years as deputy secretary of the municipal party committee
After returning to Beijing
Friends ask me
In this unforgettable experience
What is the deepest feeling
My answer is:
serious problem
More than educating farmers
More importantly, the educators themselves
Zhangjiajie is a newly developed tourist attraction
There are still many remote mountainous areas where Tujia people live in the jurisdiction
Traffic jam there
Economic difficulties
Cultural backwardness
Before leaving Beijing
I made a basic design for the work to be carried out
That is, we must use new knowledge and broaden our horizons
To educate and inspire farmers
Arouse their sense of reform
Organize to get rid of poverty
Unexpectedly, the development of things is just the opposite: it is not my bookish cadre who has educated the farmers
It’s the farmers’ practice that taught me
once
The secretary of Yongding District Party Committee told me
He has a poor village called Xiongbiyan
Farmers in the village live on the top of the alpine mountain
Semi-closed
Area
The township is working with the village to solve the problem of poverty alleviation
He hopes I can go up the mountain with the comrades in the district
Visit the folks
Mountain climbing
Only then did I really understand what mountain road insurance is
I understand why the mountain has been
Isolated
———The only channel
It takes half a day to climb
Use both hands and feet in dangerous places
This is the road that the Tujia mountain people stepped on where there was no road
Is their way of survival to communicate with the outside world
Seems to be the main factor restricting their development
Climb the bear wall rock
We go to the village
The difficulty of some people’s lives
Surprised me
Heart is heavy
But what also surprised me was
Simple and enthusiastic Tujia brothers
Old and young
I didn't cry for poverty
There is only one topic for everyone: building roads
The first secretary of the village branch (in addition to the secretary of the party’s grassroots branch, there are
First secretary
Xiongbiyan may be a pioneering work
This is a part-time job for the deputy secretary of the township
If you don’t get rid of poverty, you can’t go down the mountain) summarizes the reasons:
Area
The township has been engaged in science and technology poverty alleviation for two years
Successful trial planting of off-season melons and vegetables on the mountain
The key is not going down the mountain
Not become money
Can't get out of poverty
A sister-in-law heard
Female secretary
Up the mountain
Come with a torch
Hold my hand tightly
Open the loud voice of Xiangxi people:
It is the duty of the common people to grow land and pay for food
But the government sees difficulties on the mountain
Put
Imperial food
All free
People in the mountains know
Now everyone is dedicated to building roads
If these poor days remain unchanged
Sorry government
Sorry Deng Xiaoping's good policy
Facing this steamy scene
Originally wanted
Enlighten education
Farmers' thoughts
I don't know where to go
I just thought silently
They are not highly educated
Maybe I haven’t read Comrade Deng Xiaoping’s book
Maybe not very clear about the vigorous reform and opening up situation outside the mountain
But they think
Said
Comrade Xiaoping
Development is the last word
Thoughts are so consistent
So consistent with the reform requirements
on the other hand
Party Central Policy
Thoughts of Comrade Xiaoping
How connected to the hearts of hundreds of millions of ordinary people
The folks of Xiongbiyan
I am 4,000 miles away waiting for you to get out of poverty as soon as possible
I'm with dad

Spring couplets
Jin Liwen
Dad loves to write couplets
Every year on the twenty-eighth lunar month, write couplets to the villagers
one year
There are households
Blind
I made a series of couplets for my father
Write it vertically after going back
Fat pig
When it was posted on the front door
Make a joke
This happened
Every year on New Year’s Day
Dad must wear that gray tunic suit that symbolizes his status as a teacher
Take me out for a turn
See if the couplet of the host is properly posted
Is the Xijia couplet upside down?
Over time
Became a habit
Someone joked
Mr. Jin, this is a couplet
in fact
father
reward
Couplets are meant to be checked and corrected
Year after year
Dad is writing couplets here
reward
More than 20 years have been spent in the couplet
I also became a college student from my child
now
I have been working for seven or eight years
Chinese New Year
Sister called long ago
Tell me
Phone at home
Ate tap water
With refrigerator
Color TVs are available
I laughed
I think this is just a propaganda campaign launched by my sister to urge me to visit home earlier
Believe it when I get home
All this is true
First day
Dad dressed up
Want me to go out with him again
My heart
Still the old habits haven't changed
reward
Couplet go
Out the door
Dad walked slowly with his hands behind his back
Dong Jia Xi Jia Di rewards his couplet
I look around looking for the old
Then I noticed
Great changes have taken place in the village
It’s not just after opening up
Make a fortune
Couplet
I have to try it out
Dozens of thatched houses scattered on a sunny slope that year no longer exist
Instead, there are all brick houses
The former production team compound has become a chicken farm and a rice noodle processing center
The former elementary school is also brilliant
I can’t find the shadow of when I was in school
Even the road in front of the village is paved with gravel
No more deep marks from the wheels
Especially conspicuous is the old well in the village
Liu Dou has been taken away
Take down the well platform
Only the bald head is left
There are a few weeds around
Look at the couplet again
Colorful
Colorful
Long short wide narrow
All kinds of
Printed bronzing handwritten
Variety
suddenly
I feel a little strange
Take a closer look
I understand
original
This is no longer my familiar couplet
The couplet I am familiar with was written by my father
I took a look at dad
I saw him still watching
I'm weird
This is not what he wrote
What else to watch
Is it necessary to check and correct?
At this moment
I saw that the couplets of a family were not straight or straight
Just said to dad:
Look at the couplet
Dare to post
Dad took a look at me
Looked at the couplet again and said:
I thought the same for the first two years
Now it's time to think about it
Don't look at the crooked writing of that character
But people can write it out by themselves
It's not easy
Look at it a few years ago
A few literate
At this moment
I just understand
The village I know is lost
The lost village has progressed
True Love Writes the Soul of the Heroes-Introduction to "Legend of Zhang Hao"
Li Yian
Zhang Hao (formerly Lin Yuying)
Is the outstanding leader of our labor movement
February 25th of this year
Is the centenary of his birth

Participated in the revolution in 1921
Lin Yunan in February 1922
Yun Daiying introduces joining the party
Successively in Wuhan
Changsha
Yellowstone
Anyuan
Shanghai
Guangzhou
Hong Kong
Harbin
Fushun and other places engaged in the labor movement
March 6, 1942
Died in Yan'an due to illness
Mao Zedong and other central leaders personally carried the coffin
then
Zhang Hao was dispatched by the Communist International
Departing from Moscow alone
Via the Mongolian People's Republic
Through the middle of nowhere
Arrived in Yan'an
At the critical moment of the revolutionary struggle, the instructions of the Communist International were brought to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
He split the party in Zhang Guotao
A critical time to split the Red Army
Entrusted by Mao Zedong
Did a lot of hard and meticulous work
Finally, Zhang Guotao’s conspiracy failed to succeed
Make the Communist Party of China and the cause of China's revolution turn the crisis into peace once again
Thus in party history
Left a most outstanding stroke in military history
Time goes by
Zhang Hao has been lying silently in the cemetery in Yan'an for 55 years.
Some people remember him
But more people including the author are not yet
understanding
he
The good news is
The long biography "Legend of Zhang Hao" (published by Zhuhai Publishing House)
Pass rigorous research
Informative historical data
Careful conception and simple but flexible brushwork
Intensively depicts the magnificent historical picture half a century ago
Thus recreating Zhang Hao’s legendary revolutionary career
Reappears Zhang Hao’s charisma and personality
Author Lu Zhiluo
Meimen made in the book
Based on historical documentary
Properly blend in the techniques of literary creation
In the selection and use of materials
Strive to be detailed
Precise and vivid
The details are often set at a turning point in Zhang Hao’s life
Or to show Zhang Hao’s intelligence
Courageous scenes and performance when he matured politically
Such as establishing Liqun Towel Factory
Leading the strike struggle at Hanyang Iron and Steel Plant
Bloody Qingyun Road
Wit struggle in Shenyang prison, etc.
Outline the growth trajectory of Zhang Hao
But slightly
Although I have taken
Less materials used
But more sophisticated
very convincing
Such as when showing the affection between father and son
The author strips Zhang Hao off his son's clothes
At the same time, he was naked and hugged his son to sleep tightly.
Used twice
Just one move
The kind of parent-child love that throws away a family member for the revolution but misses their own flesh
Immediately expressed vividly
Touching
Can't help but remind people of Mr. Lu Xun
How pitiful not husband
Verses come
This is a good book worth reading
I hope people who read "Legend of Zhang Hao" can be moved
Sentiment
I hope that the spiritual power of Comrade Zhang Hao can be inherited and carried forward in today’s new generation of Communists.
If so
Comrade Zhang Hao knows well
Also smile
The Dance of the Capital
Deng Youmei
There is a Japanese student
Show me his master's thesis
The title surprised me:
An Investigation on the Dancing Style of Beijingers
I go to the park to walk early every day
Watching dude and old sisters dance fast and flat disco
Quite interested
But did not expect to investigate
Old Beijinger
Regardless of the flag
I don't have much talent for dancing
The education he received since childhood is
Stand up
Sit and sit
Don't shake your hands and your feet are out of shape
Sing Kunqu Opera
Single string
Erhuang has roots
There is no way to engage in physical art
Held at the beginning of the founding
National Folk Music and Dance Performance
Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture was ordered
Dig
program
Easy music
Mr. Cha Fuxi discovered
Zhihua Temple
The monk played ancient music from the Tang Dynasty
Ask a few high monks to put on cadre uniforms and come on stage to blow
Just get a full house
Dance but caught blind
Finally
Find
How many aunts in the suburbs of Beijing will fight
Taiping drum
Please come and dance with North Korea in Yanbian
Peacock dance in Yunnan
Beijingers sighed
I haven't heard of performing since
Beijing has risen twice after liberation
Dancing wind
But all
Be ordered to thrive
Once was
Leaning to one side
Time
Learn Russian ballroom dance
At first people just stood on the side watching the excitement
No one is willing to pull the opposite sex off to jump
But can't stop the superiors' call
Leaders take the lead
Youth League members as backbone
Finally formed
Create a batch
Dance fan
Dancing wind
Someone summarized the process by saying:
Uncomfortable
Stand on the edge
Try it
Die
Finally this
Die
Prove that people have turned from passive to active
The first dancing wind made
Mass voluntary activities
Qualifications
The second gust is
Cultural Revolution
Mid jump
Loyalty dance
Is the standard bearer
Cultural dictatorship
One of
Are you eligible to jump
To the enemy
I distinguish between
Those who are in a separate volume are not eligible to skip
But you have to bend over and watch others jump
Receive education
Qualified to jump
Jump or not
How to jump
Is one of the ways to test his loyalty
It has its value
If someone performs today
Loyalty dance
Sure to eat
Reminiscence
The role of
Make people remember the merits of Comrade Deng Xiaoping in settling chaos
Now Beijingers are developing this style of dancing
Absolutely different from the previous two
It is a spontaneous activity of the masses
Most of its planners are elderly citizens
Japanese students have seen this characteristic
Write it as a master's thesis
The Japanese youth mentioned earlier spent more than a year
Observed dozens of dance spots in the park square
Interviewed dozens of people
Dancing
Enthusiasts
Counted hundreds of numbers
More than ten projects listed
There are three to four thousand words in a paper
I read all day
I found that the little things around the people in Beijing can be learned by foreigners
It's really convincing
What I am most convinced is his judgment on the cause of this dancing wind
It quotes the confession of an elderly dance fan:
Led by Deng Xiaoping
I'm rich
Free spirit
Want to live a few more years
Retirement needs to have a good time
I didn't dance when I was young
Not like jumping
I am embarrassed in front of everyone
just now
Now the Chinese don’t look at others and live their lives
Just dance yourself happily
Don't like it
Maybe you didn’t appreciate the level
Eligibility for ranking
Wu Jincai
Ranking is not such a great event
The era of no family planning
Which family does not have a boss
Second child
Old man
What
now
Business competition is raging
The knowledge of ranking was suddenly discovered to be a good way to occupy the position of public opinion.
then
Ranking has become a wing of the business war
But this one
Things are going bad again
Now enter the market economy
Fierce competition
Countless companies
Countless goods are there
No white no row
What I want to ask is: people who come out
Qualified
Or within what scope is the qualification valid
just now
Some bookstores just opened a few years ago
Are all listed in the newspapers
××Bestseller list
Come
But it doesn’t publish the number one book
How many copies did you sell in your shop
Ambiguous one announced
What kind of information do people know?
I thought
Such a bookstore might as well settle down first
Strive to expand market share
Make yourself bigger
Let’s talk about ranking
I'm afraid it's more authoritative
otherwise
If the reader is more genuine
Let you now announce the specific number of bestsellers sold on each ranking to see
The bottom of the scale of your store is leaking
I'm afraid I will show my ugliness
From the specific store
I think it’s better to learn Beijing’s "Sanlian" ranking method: set up a sign at the gate of the store
Last week's best sellers and their specific sales
At a glance
But this is only for my readers
Not in a hurry to spread to society
Be less interested in publishing
I'm afraid it's more beneficial
Ranking of business and industry
Not much cultural
In the past
It's just based on a few people's opinions
This gold award
That silver award
For a period of time
Some industries have more gold awards than silver awards
There are more silver awards than bronze awards
Totally gone
just now
Enterprise awards are explicitly prohibited
Don't do it
however
Ranking in survey
Allow consumers to see the scale and style of the company
So companies are very keen
This one
Ranking itself has become a highly competitive industry
Just talk about ranking the market share of home appliances
There are several
Incomplete statistics
Appear in the newspaper
Come and go
There is something called
Top 100 shopping malls by sales volume
What actually shows is a kind of enterprise marketing strategy
It does not represent the complete results of the enterprise's production and marketing --- the Central Committee held a call to expand the rural market
Some companies mainly sell to small and medium towns
Some small and medium shopping malls specializing in big cities
You only rank according to the sales performance of 100 shopping malls
This list is not authoritative
Is a natural thing
Ranking things
Big or not
Say small
If you make internal reference
It doesn't matter
And once the results of the ranking are published to the society
The qualification of rankers is important
One is the need for self-discipline
Second, industry managers are required to impose other disciplines
otherwise
All kinds of announcements
List
You don't trust people
People will not believe in you
It's useless for others and yourself

Only with a spiritual support
I can get on the road

Water (1)
Cracked skin and land
Need a tonic
Beyond conquest
Xihaiguren
Still keep the goodness
Take it seriously
Facing the loess and back to the sky
Just the outline of the landscape
Too many details
Hard to say
Sweat and mud
Picture of
Not only touching
Also heavy
Shepherd (2)
Different from businessmen in the city
Grazing is the wealth of the villagers

I spend most of my life in Dashan
Drive sheep uphill
Chew with the lamb
Mountains and the meaning of life
In the eyes of the faintly wandering mountains
Maybe a kind of
Others can never share
The mood of
The crisp sound of the whip
Is the rainbow at dusk
Ironing posts in Dashan in my hometown
And country atrium
Strands of cooked tobacco
Home is the starting point of life
Is also the end of life
The child's call (3)
The vision that just sprouted
Lost in the silence of the mountain
Stepping on the hoof prints of cattle and sheep
You are with your parents
Ploughing and harvesting
Before the ancient stone mill
The shriveled grains of wheat slipped off
A huge question mark fell from the sky
Rough land
Is it just sweat?
Sweat has flowed too much
Pure and anxious eyes
Traversing
Along the crisp and alluring bell
Pursuing the rising flag

A real call
Turbulent the entire Chinese land———
Lend me a pair of wings
I will hold out a splendid sky
Wheat harvest season (4)
In the golden wheat waves

Stand out all summer
Mature wheat
Fall to the ground
Spread from the feet of father into
Another kind of ocean
Father sweats like rain
Father stood up and wiped his sweat
Regardless of Chinese painting, oil painting and carving
Still photography
Is a masterpiece
The sun is still busy on the forehead
Some kind of sweet by the sun
Grilled more attractive
Infiltrate home with the wind
And relatives outside of home

Xihaigu's smile stretched out and drank it
Sweet water played by the people's soldiers
Nowadays
Xihaigu is wearing a suit skirt
Dancing lightly and singing

Xihaiguren got on the train
Upper Beijing and Lower Jiangnan
Nowadays
Xihaigu people fly across the ocean by plane
Introduce foreign capital to build a hometown

Potatoes have become golden beans

Xihaigu people are grateful
Reform and opening up and poverty alleviation and development policies
Nowadays
Xihaigu people firmly believe that tomorrow will be better
Hope this day together
Tan Zhong Chi
Open a recently published film and television publication in Hong Kong
Witness the picture of Miss Peng Dan wearing a red cheongsam in the pictorial
I feel a light breeze blowing
Then read next to the photo
Miss Peng Dan is wearing a red dress
It seems to make people feel the warm atmosphere of Hong Kong's return to the motherland
instruction of
Also made my inspiration fly to that solemn and great day
I asked Miss Peng Dan if she really meant it
She didn't answer me directly
Just smiled and said
Back to Hong Kong
I am very busy all day
I always hope that this day will come early
Peng Dan told me
She is very cautious now
Think seriously about everything
And strictly require yourself to do well
She is willing to suffer
Can also endure hardship
Sometimes I work more than 10 hours a day
She still has to maintain her strong acting mood
I said to Peng Dan
While filming
Must read more
This is what some film and television actors lack
then
I asked what songs she sang
Peng Dan said with regret
Are all sung by others
Of course I hope there is a song I sing first
Can you write me lyrics
of course can
My promise was born in a tall building in this bustling world
At that time, Peng Dan's eyes flashed with excitement and trust
The reporters present also laughed heartily
I feel this song is unusual
You must devote your efforts and emotions
Days and nights of returning to the hot land of central Hunan
Despite busy business
But the corner of my heart is trembling with this promised note
night
Moon night
This is a night full of united thinking and affection
Is a night of poems and stories
It's also a night to send longing and blessings
I opened the moon cake box on the table alone
Lightly holding moon cakes that are round and white like the moon
The faint scent of cakes is in my heart
That round pie
Shake my mind
Carrying my heart out of the window
Outside the window is an unusually peaceful and holy moonlit world
The rose bush in the flowerbed in front of the window sill is kissing the moonlight infatually
Swaying beautiful flower shadows
Everything is picturesque
Everything sank into a dreamlike and hazy state
The sun will be brighter tomorrow
Tomorrow's breeze is fresher
Tomorrow's flowers and plants are more beautiful
Tomorrow night will be more peaceful
The bird on the branch no longer sings melancholy
The boats on the lake no longer circle melancholy
I want to stretch my light sleeves
To embrace your own tomorrow
Hope this day together
How many years have you been looking forward to
I want to sing joyfully
I want to indulge in love
Lover
Don't hate the ticket in hand anymore
And cut the strings of the soul
Courtyard wet in moonlight
In the dark courtyard
In the courtyard decorated with dreams
In the courtyard with stories
The lyrics of my song "Hope for this day" came out of my mind
I long for it to fly
now
I don’t know if Peng Dan is also hovering under the moon
Are you also dreaming of flying by yourself

Reading "Qian Zhongshu and Chinese Cultural Spirit"
Lu Wenhu
recent years
There are more and more books about Qian Zhongshu’s creation and academic works
This is undoubtedly a good thing
but
We have to admit
These so-called research works
Some are just the works of barnyard sellers
of course
I have also seen several very creative
Be ingenious
Discovery and invention
A book worth reading
Professor Zang Kehe’s work "Qian Zhongshu and the Spirit of Chinese Culture"
Is one of them
Read this book
I got more than just a surprise impression
And also feel satisfied
Qian Zhongshu is a writer and scholar at the same time
As a writer
His novel
Prose and poems directly face ordinary readers
Has had a wide-ranging impact
Has a considerable popularity
But as a scholar
His thoughts
theory
Views and methods
Is far from being known
Popularize Qian Zhongshu
Easy talk
"Pipe Cone"
"Tan Yi Lu" is written in elegant classical Chinese
I personally think that the author never did this to save space
There is only one possible reason
That is to maintain its high cultural style and academic level
therefore
These works
universal
To the extent that middle school students can understand
Is not a very realistic idea
Ideal approach
Is this
universal
Work within a certain range
For example, limit it to a certain major in the humanities
As Zang Kehe did
Mr. Zheng Chaozong once pointed out
Qian Zhongshu’s academic research has one
Constrain the fiction
specialty
Zang Kehe did capture this feature
This book starts from the perspective of linguistics
Qian Xue
Breaking through the barriers of poetics by elementary school
It has achieved great results in expressing modern thinking by traditional methods
The author selects some representative characters from Qian Zhongshu’s works
word
sentence
segment
Discrimination and mining
And also comment on his works
Use Qian Zhongshu's usual aspect comparison
Participate in the method of getting through each other to study Qian Zhongshu
From image to meaning
because
real
s
Imaginary
Zang Kehe's approach is to draw inferences from one another
Discussing the source along the wave: the carrier of language and writing began to grow
To reach the body
in other words
From the form of expression and the content of thought
From language to cultural spirit
I think
This book is not a book based on Hehan's big words
It's not a straightforward fuck
Interesting book
Can be seen from the book
In order to truly understand Qian Zhongshu
Research Qian Zhongshu
Read a large number of cultural classics involved in Qian Zhu
Considered many basic questions mentioned by Qian
That’s why he can deduce a lot of evidence to explain
Qian Xue
Implication
When he finally got through
After reading Chinese cultural spirit from Chinese characters
His epiphany
Understanding level etc.
A new ascent or even a qualitative leap has taken place
Has a fundamental improvement
then
We have this book which studies the spirit of Chinese culture from the perspective of linguistics
Read to the end
I find
The significance of this linguistics monograph
Has gone far beyond itself
Has important cultural and philosophical value
Memories That Cannot Be Burned-Reading the Diary of John Rabe
Jiang Wei
Report: On the occasion of the Nanjing Massacre
John Rabe, a German citizen working there, is desperate to protect Chinese refugees
At the same time, in more than 2,000 pages of his diary, he fully recorded the atrocities committed by the Japanese army to rape and murder innocent women.
The newly discovered diary of Rabe becomes another hard evidence of the Nanjing Massacre by Japanese invaders
One
Slept in the attic for more than half a century
When you touch it, it makes a thunderbolt
John Rabe has passed away nearly half a century
A Chinese city is still in his diary
cry
Those days when Nanjing was flooded with blood
The days when Nanjing was smashed by a butcher knife
The cries of women and children were cut off
day
Autumn wind and cold rain swept over those tired bones
day
As if a nightmare was swept away by the sun's fingers
The fireworks in the sky turned Nanjing into a crematorium
I want to burn all memories
John Rabe is dead
He lives angrily in the diary
Guarding at the entrance of hell shouted:
Kind people
Be vigilant and vigilant
Yes
The blood gloves of the butchers have long been washed white
Put on perfume
Human smell
Still compelling blood
The forgetful gentlemen want people to turn around
Do you want to put on those snow-white gloves
Cover your eyes
Play another game of beheading
two
Assassinated
Dozens of Chinese refugees converge into a crying ocean
you
A lonely German
Cang hair fluttering to stand up
Stretch out long arms
Skinny
Like a statue on a long embankment
A saber to stop the animal
And the blood wave brought in by the bitter wind and rain
For the suffering China
You declare to fascists the brutality of fascists
For history
You condemn the death it spreads to death
You prove to mankind
Justice is always a barrier to life
You are on the butcher's tombstone
Carve out the shame and complaint that will never be erased
Won
Heroes board the monument
You are like a tired old gun
Silently walked into the peace and forgetfulness of the town
That distant rainy night
You died quietly
No comment
But left a huge thunder
Rumble on the echo wall of history
Let humans tear up the rags of the liar
Let history remember the trauma of war
Let the kids take off with the pigeons
Hold up the peaceful sun in the blue sky
That is a peaceful cemetery
You slept lonely for nearly half a century
Engraved on the stele
A forgotten name
You are for China and the world
Leave a historical record that should not be forgotten
I tearfully offered a bunch of late blooming flowers
Another upright and brave soul
Breathing in the sun in China...
Watching Kunlun
Xiao Ping
The outpost is set up in the snow wrapped in ice
On the top of the howling wind
Climb to the observatory
Everything is reckless in the field of vision
Everlasting snow mountain peaks
That is always endless
Mountains glowing white
Majestic and desolate
The majestic and distant Karakoram Mountains
Billions of years ago
Karakorum is still a blue ocean
later
The moment no one can tell
With thunderous noises
The black cloud rushes like a monster
The sea retreats to Shino
Rock through the sky
Earth and sky
huge
Taupe young mountains rise slowly from the ancient sea of ​​Tethys
Solidified into endless peaks
The cold north wind rushes from the sky
Long and slow
Continuous and uninterrupted
Since the snowy plateau was born
It seems that this place has become a lifeless land
The flora and fauna of the underwater world in the early years
Now it is a fossil embedded in the exposed rock
Trilobites are faintly identifiable
Nautilus
sea ​​lily
Overlord and so on
These fossils made me see the end of life
city
rural
street
Cooking smoke
Here is misty and distant like a mirage
All I have here is the cold desert wind
The howling of the wind is like a grand sound of heaven
because
This is already a frozen layer
5380 meters above sea level
Average annual temperature of zero degrees Celsius
The oxygen content in the air is much lower than needed for survival
Sven Heding, a Swede once admired as a great explorer by an era
Zeng came here smugly
After he was attacked by the snow and ice of Kunlun Mountain
Stroking the lungs that are rapidly expanding due to lack of oxygen, confidently declare: The snow-covered plateau above 4,500 meters above sea level is the forbidden zone of life
People will never settle and survive
Karakorum is magnificent and magnificent because of its many towering snow mountains
Because of the boundless silence of the snowy plateau
The eternal desolation has become a broad realm
And a huge temptation for the brave
Early 50s
A team was praised by Zhou Enlai, the first prime minister of the Republic
Plateau Power
Advance company
Pulling a camel
Hold the pony tail
Cross the snow line
Mount Karakoram
snowstorm
Mudslide
collapse
Avalanche and sudden death on plateau
Really like five steel knives
Attacked them by surprise
Freeze their lives on the way to march
But the tough soldiers
Ignore the raging wind and snow in Karakorum
Ignore any dissuasion and threats
Stubbornly advance
go ahead
the climb
the climb
Interestingly
The advance company led the camel to climb an unknown snow mountain
It's dark
Xuefeng is like a sharp sword
There was a cold light in the night
They slept all night under the belly of a camel
The next morning
Shake off the snow
Look around
Yo
The mountain is built of ice
The ground is paved with snow
A cloud near the peak
Money into the sky
I blurted out: It’s really a place where gods live
then
Here has a wonderful name: Shenxian Bay

Like a ship drifting in the ocean
There is no bird in the sky
There is no green grass underground
Young Chinese soldier
But young and vigorous, I want to raise the first red flag here
Lit the first plume of smoke
Stern and distant eyes
Watching the reckless Kunlun deep and long
I walked into this post on a twilight with the setting sun
The setting sun, which lost its warmth, wiped the Kunlun Snow Mountain into orange red
Makes me feel in a daze
Seems to be stepping into a piece of blood for several degrees
The ancient battlefield
Stepping into Liantian Hujia
Qiangguanli
Face black and red
Long purple whistle
Greeted me enthusiastically into the outpost
Say welcome
Immediately lifted a hip flask
Sitting in hot water
Keep saying
Take a sip of hot pot of wine
Warm your body to drive away the cold
Hot wine kung fu
I'm talking about my feelings
On the Karakoram Mountains
Feel the temperature drop
Chest tightness
Top heavy
Walk and float
Like a spacewalk on the moon
Fortunately being on the plateau
Relative height is not seen
Look around
Highland is almost a map
Uphill and downhill is not steep or rush
The head of the sentinel smiled calmly: This is the depth and breadth of Karakorum
Once a year
From spring to winter
The wind is not tyrannical
Just blowing slowly
Inadvertently snow falling snow freezing
Will die-because of lack of oxygen and extreme cold
The young officer Shen Pengsheng was the first to fall at the snowy mountain post.
He died of illness
At first it was just a cold and fever
Soon it turns into cerebral edema
Head pain that doesn't stop
It doesn’t work if you hold your head with a backpack strap
The comrades buried him on the snow mountain behind the post
Build a tomb for him with rough stones
later
Lu Guangcheng was added next to this tomb
Zhao Jinbao's Tomb
it's here
Death and survival are very close
Ice and snow
Severe cold
Hypoxia
disease
Will kill people at any time
Life becomes fragile
The soldiers also regarded death as indifferent
But they took responsibility
Honor and the dignity of the motherland are very important
The driver, Lu Guangcheng, sacrificed to send supplies to the outpost
He has a cold
Coughing
The company commander told him not to leave the car
he thinks
National Day is coming
Don’t let the outpost comrades fail to receive holiday supplies
Unfortunately
The car broke down on Bingdaban
He endured the cold and lay down on Bingdaban to repair the car
When the car drove to the post
He has fallen into a coma
The comrades drove him to the hospital like crazy
But he never woke up
this day

Beijing of the Republic
It is a sea of ​​flowers
Sea of ​​song
But he sleeps on the Karakoram Mountains
Hundred years with snowy mountains and ice peaks
Zhao Jinbao is on New Year's Eve
In order to let my comrades sleep more
After standing on my shift
Stand another guard for your comrades
Unfortunately, he froze on the sentry position
When the company commander spotted him
He can no longer speak
But the eyes are still open, watching the reckless Kunlun
They are dead
No last words
No tombstone
I just hope to melt life into this eternal snowy plateau
Accompanying his comrades to continue guarding the Kunlun Mountains
Talking room
The wine is hot
The strong aroma of wine rippling with the wind
Disperse in the post
I pick up the wine glass
Sprinkle the wine slowly on the frozen snow beside the post
Silently praying for the souls resting in Kunlun Snow Mountain to rest in peace
these years
I have traveled almost every country on the 42,000-kilometer border and coastal defense line
Every post
I'm always searching
Thinking about such a problem
That's the borders are more desolate and cold
Lonely and distantly related
And what is the charm of the border
Seduced
Inspired
Attracted
Condensed with countless frontier soldiers
Karakorum
I'm also thinking hard
What force makes these ordinary soldiers
To Karakorum for such a long time and love
The head of the whistle told me in a hoarse voice: it is the mission of soldiers to strengthen the border and strengthen the country.
They watch every day
Is the snowy Kunlun where no grass grows
Standing in the high cold
Watch the bleak sunset
Staring at the stars
Watching Kunlun Wind and Snow
long time
Can enter a lofty state
There was an almost mysterious smile on the whistle's face
He said
For example
In the eyes of ordinary people
Karakorum’s ice peaks seem to be frozen
But in the eyes of the soldiers
That is the youngest active
The most living mountains
It changes every day
In the eyes of ordinary people
Karakorum is lonely and desolate
Hardship
But in the eyes of the soldiers
Karakorum has a magnificent majesty
That sky of ice and snow
Mu Yunkong Moraine
Howling wind
They are all beautiful with special charm
They guard Kunlun
Regarded as an honor
A kind of happiness
A kind of pride
Willing to put my ideals
Youth and even life stay in this vast plateau
Buried in the crystal clear snow mountain
In the folds of the plateau
I did not hear a soldier complaining about the hardship
The word hardship never spit out easily in the mouth of the Karakoram sentry
Ask them if they are suffering
They say they won’t be bitter when they get used to it
If you don’t think hard, you won’t be hard
Nowadays it seems to be too bitter for anyone or anything to speak lightly
But Karakoram’s soldiers are thought to be able to eat
Can train
Can survive
Is the place of heroes
But not easy
Obviously, it is to make one's soul surpass the higher peaks
Walked into a realm of life
Above the post
There is a high wall made of ice and snow
The snow wall is carved with the names of hundreds of veterans who have guarded here
That winter

Leaving this world of ice and snow
The noisy life in the city calls them
The fragrance of the soil in the hometown tempts them
But suddenly
They and this cold and solemn snow mountain and ice peaks have become hard to leave
Can't remember who suggested it
On this mountain top covered with snow all year round
Build a snow wall
Engrave your name
Accompanying later soldiers to watch Kunlun
Guard this snow mountain and ice peak
Year by year
Every veteran who left the team consciously continued this habit
The postmaster has welcomed recruits on the side many times
Farewell to the leaving veterans
Every time we send veterans away
He has unspeakable ups and downs
A veteran asked him: the postmaster
When will I send myself down the mountain?
He said: I and the snow-capped mountains are together
Yes
He has the longest years in Karakorum
His home is in the prosperous Yangtze River Delta
Every time my wife writes
Not tired of details
Tell him tirelessly
Who built a tiled villa
Who bought a luxurious Nissan sleeping car...
He understands his wife
Not to mention the prosperity of the hometown
It is the humid air that can be breathed freely in the plains
There is a great temptation for him
He did not have no reason or no chance to leave this adobe iron post in Karakorum Mountain
He is not inseparable from the plateau life where he can't even eat enough oxygen
What he can't leave behind is the duty of a soldier
He firmly believes that when the magic power of money is getting bigger and bigger
What can't be bought is the most sacred thing in the world
He is not good at talking
Did not sigh
The only pride is: as a soldier
Stand at the highest post in the world with a gun
Standing away from the blue sky
The place closest to the sun
That's a kind of luck
The head of the post and I walked side by side on the snow-covered mountain road outside the post
Perhaps it is the perception of the environment of Bingfeng and Snow Ridge
The unspoken guard said to me with deep emotion: Some people say
Snowy border is too desolate
Only those who watch Kunlun every day
Will truly discover the beauty of the snowy Kunlun
To truly experience the beauty of loneliness
Loneliness is beauty
Sadness is the essence of beauty
The soldier in front of me
Become like a poet in an instant
A philosopher
I have always believed
Hardship can smelt people
Purify people
On the land under the blue sky at the top of the mountain in Karakorum
People's emotions and souls will definitely be shaped like snow-capped mountains
As clean as an ice peak
These soldiers around me
Companion with Kunlun Snow every day
Follow the plateau wind
They will stand and become snow peaks
Fall down and become a river
Rise to become a constellation
Fly to become an eagle
Run to become a steed
They can turn into strong winds and free clouds
Integrate with the plateau
It can also become the towering snow-capped peaks of the Karakoram Mountains
Important achievements of socialist literature and art research
Wang Jucai
Comrade Zhang Jiong’s new book "On Socialist Literature and Art" (published by Huashan Literature and Art Publishing House) is an important achievement in the study of Marxist literature and art theory in my country since the new era
It discusses the theoretical issues related to socialist literature and art more systematically
For our correct understanding and adherence to Marxist literary and artistic thought
Thoroughly implement the party's literature and art policy
It has important reference value to promote the healthy development and further prosperity of socialist literature and art
First of all, this book always adheres to the popular character of socialist literature and art research
Comrade Zhang Jiong is based on Comrade Mao Zedong’s theory on the essence and function of literature and art
Pay special attention to the relationship between the development of literature and art and the great practice of the people to create their own new lives
Pay attention to exploring and implementing literature and art to serve the people
For socialism
Two for
The right way
Efforts to discover literary and artistic works from the macro and micro levels to inspire the national spirit
Cultivating moral sentiment

Marxism regards socialist humanitarianism as part of its ethical principles
Socialist literature and art should work hard to promote socialist humanitarianism
such
It has drawn a clear line from the bourgeois idealist view of history
Affirmed the subjective initiative of the practice subject
Refutes the non-historicism that once flooded
Established and expounded the correct view of historical materialism
third
Embodies a relatively distinct historical consciousness
Comrade Zhang Jiong’s theoretical research pays special attention to summing up the historical experience and lessons of the development of my country’s socialist literature and art
Combining historical practices in different periods to study and clarify the party's literary and artistic principles and policies
Reveal its rich theoretical connotation
Do well in theory and practice
Unity of history and logic
This makes his theoretical research neither a scholastic philosophy hiding in an ivory tower
Not a purely personal language game
But always pay attention to the profound historical changes in Chinese society
Follow the steady pace of modernization
Pay attention to the great practice of the people's hard work
at this point
It should be said that it is also commendable
fourth
Is targeting socialist literature and art
Under the premise of being guided by Marxism-Leninism Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping’s theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics
In terms of overall structure and specific discussion, this book
All show an open mind
The author does not study socialist literature and art in isolation
But put it in the background of profound changes in China’s 20th century history
Put in the big vision of the world's new trend of literature and art in the 20th century
Through retractable
Comparing vertically and horizontally to investigate

Remember the history
Liu Qi from Xi'an Qingyun Middle School
Hong Kong
Very eye-catching on the beautiful map of China
I remember when I looked at the big map of China when I was a child, I had a whim: Hong Kong is much like a bright pearl on the motherland’s beautiful clothes.
just
A little strange
Beside it
Have a harsh brace
"Ying Zhan" is clearly printed inside
Ying Zhan
What do you mean
why
Me at the time
Still can't understand
Just a series of don't understand
As the years go by
I grow up
Childhood mystery
Unraveled in the history books full of blood and tears
I started to understand
"British Occupy" next to the map of Hong Kong
It's the mark left by the British colonists looting China step by step
History also made me understand the vicissitudes of Hong Kong's century of drifting
Make me understand
The reason why China was arbitrarily insulted by the British
The root cause lies in backwardness
In the nineteenth century
Britain, which pioneered the technological revolution, has become the "world factory"
And China is still lingering in the ancient agricultural civilization
So on one side is the steam locomotive whizzing
On one side is a wooden ox cart crawling slowly
One side is the sparkle shining
On one side is the erratic candlelight
gigantic difference
Cast into artificial swords
I'm the tragedy of fish
On the billowing battlefield
Of course the cold light of the broad sword cannot withstand the tongue of the guns
Land reparation and compensation became commonplace in the Qing Dynasty
Lagging behind
Ignorance being bullied
This is the truth behind it
National shame bites the hearts of Chinese people
Tears are hot
Blood is burning
In order to completely change China's poor and weak face
To restore the jewel of the motherland
Countless people with lofty ideals
Lifelong search
Countless Chinese heroes went on to succeed
Blood Recommendation Xuanyuan...
The footsteps of history set foot in the 1980s
In the clarion that "science and technology are the primary productive forces"
The motherland is rising in the east of the world
In the ancient city of Xi'an where I live
Formerly desolate countryside
The miraculous rise of high-tech parks
Long March rockets made from here
Send satellites into space
A frame of silver swallows born from here
Soaring in the clouds of the motherland
A TV set from here
Bring laughter to thousands of households
Look across the country
A developed city like Xi'an is even more prosperous
And it was the prosperity of the motherland that gradually turned the hope of Hong Kong's return into reality.
July 1, 1997
The time for the Chinese people to be proud has finally arrived
Hong Kong under the five-star red flag and bauhinia flag makes us full of pride
At the same time it makes us feel our sacred responsibility
Mankind is about to enter the threshold of the 21st century
In this century
Advanced and backward
Ignorance and civilization still determine the status and dignity of a country in the world of nations
And this important task will be borne by us
Let's hold hands
Side by side
Arm your mind with science and knowledge
Create tomorrow with hard work and wisdom

Last ten minutes
Tang Da
Love watching football on weekdays
Especially in the last ten minutes
Longtan drums on the court
Tiger's Den
The audience in the stands was thunderous
Green Athletes are in battle
Two armies facing each other
Inextricably killed
Especially when 1:0
The loser will never let go
Even if the liver and brain are smeared
Have to win back this ball
Or a tie
For example 1:1
Then it will be more beautiful
The two armies have no hesitation at this time
Everyone is vying for the first place
All courageous
Time is getting shorter and shorter
All kinds of thrills
Strange trick
Unique skill
Often achieve a colorful
Breathtaking degree
Time passes by
Getting closer and closer to the final whistle
But good team players
Will never relax the last ten minutes
five minutes
Even a minute
Then and now
Only one purpose
Struggling to win
Strive for the final perfection
At this moment
I always treat these excellent teams
Good player
Full of respect and sigh
And my thoughts are lingering
Imagination
in fact
Isn't life like this
On the way of growth
There is always a period of old age
Years and Times
Time is running out
Not far from blowing the final whistle
People often inevitably give birth to a lot of sadness
Even a generation of heroes like Cao Cao
Inevitable
Singing to wine
Life geometry
Such as morning dew
Harder days
Deep emotion
More people are even more inevitable
Bewildered
No sleep
Feel the sunset
Nothing to do
Only the delay is over
In fact, in terms of attitude towards life
This is so wrong
The last ten minutes of the stadium are colorful
Is the proof
If which team
Which player
Because it's near the end
Frustrated
Self-destruct
Self-willing
It's definitely inevitable
coward
Guilty
Not promising
Curses and accusations
Because it's hard work
Have to fight till the end
Last minute and second
Not to the end
Never give up
Many accomplished historical figures
Adopted in life
It's exactly this attitude
The last breath of Mr. Hua Luogeng's life
End on the academic forum of visiting Japan
Zola
Suddenly died at the desk where he was writing
When Mr. Feng Zhi was terminally ill
Still pour out heart songs to friends:
Compared with Qu Yuan
Insignificant
But I am also willing to do a little bit of work for casting Huang Zhong who was destroyed by others...
Lu Xun spent his whole life
Practiced
I recommend Xuanyuan with my blood
Long-cherished wish
Premier Zhou worry about the country and the people
All year round
Unswervingly completed his youth
Face the wall for ten years
Hard to repay the sea and also a hero
High ambition
Not long ago
Read the article by the old Guangdong writer Su Chen on old age
He said:
Years have stolen your youth
Person’s age cannot be modified
however
Don't worry about the stage that nature draws in your life
He said that he agreed with what the philosopher had said:
Know how to mature in old age
Is a wise masterpiece
Is one of the hardest chapters in life skills
I think
Wonderful last ten minutes of hard work on the green court
Is the best answer to the perfect life skills in this hardest chapter
Only then
When the final whistle blows
You can be like Beethoven
Facing the world calmly:
Lords
Comedy is over
Langfang's gongs and drums
Sun Weidong
Even on a normal day
You take to the street
Or indoor desk
You can hear the cheerful gongs and drums
This has almost become a major feature of the emerging city of Langfang
Looking for the reputation of gongs and drums
What you see
It's a red car
It's a bright gong
Mighty drum
He is a gong and drum man with a smile on his face
indeed
In Langfang
Festive or unusual
And the gongs and drums often ring
This is neither advocated by anyone
It's not a good thing
But people want to knock
I want to play
It's a comfortable day that is exciting
The emotion of joy is beyond words
I used to beat the gongs and drums to express it
It's really a festival
You are going to be overwhelmed by the sound of gongs and drums
The whole street is full of jubilant people
And the sky above the city resounded with agitated gongs and drums
In the sound of gongs and drums
Float parade
Singing
Dancing
Laughter
The flow of people is colored
Gongs and drums are charming
Usually you can be alone, confused, melancholy and painful
But this moment
The gray mood will fly to the sky with the festive gongs and drums
Live now
If you are not from Langfang
Only live
Only then can you appreciate the fascinating night life of Langfang people
The night that seemed to be stirred by the sound of gongs and drums
Every sound of gongs and drums
The lights are flashing
People who are active in dancing and fitness
Yangko in Langfang
Isn't it famous?
otherwise
Why is it so popular?
Big girl
Little wife
Old man
Down to young children
They are yangko
All have a special love
Look at their joyful stamping
Lively twists and brilliant smiles
All heartfelt
Utter devotion
And the rhythm of the rhythm
Tempt everyone to go
Joyful
Tao however is involved
Especially don’t miss the weekend night in Langfang
Every square on weekend night
People like sea
Song like tide
The gongs and drums also seem to never move tirelessly
The square party has its own characteristics
Colorful
May
Laborer's Song
July
Ode to Party Soul
August
Military flag red
October
Sing the motherland
...
Different themes at different times
Different venues
A different kind of show
Singing and dancing
It's an expression of the true feelings of Langfang people
Curtain rises and falls
Showcasing the sincere dedication of Langfang people
Don't think
As an emerging city
Langfang should lack culture
Langfang is an urban-rural junction
The strong folk tradition is exactly her rich cultural accumulation
And in the revitalization of the economy
Langfang people are creating
Develop and form its own characteristic culture
She has her own song
Own flower
There is a name called Shenzhou
Color weekend
Just say this gong and drum
The gongs and drums that hit the streets almost every day
Can you say it is not the culture of Langfang
It is not only the culture of Langfang
And it just represents the active work of Langfang people
Enterprising spirit
Knock it up
Everyone in Langfang is playing their own gongs and drums
To inspire fighting spirit
Build a home
This is the gong and drum of prosperity
Is the gong and drum of celebration
It's even more civilized
Bao Gong drives the donkey (1 picture attached)
Yu Lu
Ordinary people watching opera
The picture is happy
The happiest thing is watching the scene of eliminating evil and promoting good
Therefore, the drama of Bao Gong’s verdict is equally popular
You guy Bao on the stand
Dark face
A face of selflessness
There are also sun and moon patterns on the face
Show the great ability of breaking sun and yin at night
Risangyang is a villain who punishes the world
Night Broken Yin is better
Even the evil spirits of the Yin Cao Jifu
This is really exhausted
I watched Bao Gong play when I was young
A sense of security: there is such an upright government in the world
Where are the bad guys
I watched the theater for 80 years
There are many Baogong plays I have seen: what "Qin Xianglian"
Chen Luma, who was greedy for wealth and refused to recognize his ex-wife, was given a tiger head by Bao Gong
The emperor's mother can't talk about love
What "Bao Bao Mian"
Bao Gong’s nephew is also guilty of corruption and bribery
What "Woben"
No matter how concealed the murder case is, we have to solve it
What "Explore the Yin Mountain"
The grievances of the underworld have to be found out
This Bao Gong Bao Long Tu Bao Heizi is the incarnation of justice
Look at him wearing black yarn on the stage
Wearing official gown
Wearing platform boots
Walk one step and three swing
There are also four guards from the Mahan Dynasty of Zhang Long and Zhao Hu
So majestic and murderous
But this kind of Bao Gong opera is sung too much and there is a soup problem
So the writers have to renovate
This "Bao Gong Catch the Donkey" is very innovative
This play says
Gong Bao worked hard all his life
Beard white
Deserve
Retreat to the second line
In the past, Chenzhou released food for disaster relief
One case in person
This time the court reassigned a government office
Unexpectedly, this ya Nei raised food prices
Make a fortune
Bao Gong has heard of
I went to Chenzhou for an unannounced visit
He disguised himself as a working people along the way
Encountered a singing girl
Ride a donkey to the yamen to accompany the ya Nei to drink for fun
Accidentally fell off the donkey
Bao Gong is righteous
Help her on the donkey
Escort all the way
Selling singing girls only as Bao Gong is a poor old man
Just chat casually
Told all the corruption she knew about
So Gong Bao further investigated
Personal evidence
I have to ask about the sin of Ya Nei
Audience see here
Always applaud
Watching Bao Gong's case
Watching him sit in court and beat the table and move the torture instrument
Still a little worried
I'm always afraid of making mistakes with this method
Let go of the real bad guys
You can watch the play "Bao Gong Drives the Donkey"
I feel at ease in my heart: this is a precise one
For example, see "Shi Gong An"
Lord Shi sits in court to ask the case to no point
Always pretend to be ordinary people and go into private investigations
As a result, many strange cases have been solved
If someone asks me:
You have seen many Baogong plays
Which one is best
I will answer without hesitation:
Naturally it is "Bao Gong Drives the Donkey"
Bao Gong is Bao Gong after all
If it's someone who has a good status
We have to send someone to inform
Then the guards called forward and then hugged
How to find out the truth

Twenty-nine migrant workers and migrant girls from all over Anhui Province who went to Beijing were huddled together
This county is called Jieshou City
The number of this minibus is
Anhui K11683
We took this minibus at Hefei Tourist Station on the afternoon of February 16th
16:30 on the same day
A young man holding a picture
Beijing
The signboard is walking around the square of Hefei Railway Station
See me carrying luggage
Just stepped forward and asked me if I came to Beijing
he told me
You can get to Beijing in 18 hours
I ask
How much does it cost to get to Beijing
He said 200 yuan
Departs at 17:00
Get off at Beijing Yongdingmen Station
I think he speaks well
Just get in the car and find a seat
I have a total of 30 people in the car
16:50
The flight attendant began to collect the fare
The passengers fry the pot
Shouted:
Didn't you say it's done
To Beijing 190 yuan
Why are you charging 200 yuan now?
You don't want to sit
Just get off
The dissatisfied passenger had to pay 200 yuan
Others see it
Silently paid 200 yuan
Someone murmured:
It's 190 yuan
Now I have to pay 200 yuan
Deceive
The flight attendant does not give official tickets
Just give an Anhui Province road transport ticket with a denomination of 30 yuan.
17 o'clock
The driver starts the engine on time
But I'm not leaving the car
When the night appears dimly
We saw the outline of fields and villages outside the car window
I breathed a sigh of relief
Thought
You can get to Beijing until tomorrow afternoon
All people think
The direction of this car should be true north
And actually
This car is driving towards the northwest of Hefei
Midnight
After we were bumped for more than 6 hours
Stop at a small station
Ask the flight attendant
Fangzhi is Jieshou Station
The flight attendant disappeared after getting off the car
Many people in the car huddled together and fell asleep
This is the scenario described at the beginning of this article

Jieshou
I have never been
Unexpectedly, it was this way the first time I came to Jieshou
Look up at the watch
It is already 3 o'clock in the morning on February 17

Waited until the white fish belly appeared in the east
5:30
Anhui K11683
The flight attendant finally appeared
As soon as they opened the door
Yelled:
Get off
Get off
Change train to Beijing
The passengers are at a loss
Some refused to get off
But in the end everyone got off
The flight attendant took us to a dilapidated bus
The reporter came to watch
I saw the license plate number was
Anhui K11625
There are books in yellow paint on the front of the car
State-run
The words
three
Back to
Anhui K11625
In the car
The crew on the bus shouted:
Passengers coming from Hefei
Each person will take out another 120 yuan ticket to Beijing
Passengers from Hefei exploded
Got off the train to find the station manager
At this moment
Here comes a manager in uniform
Flight attendant
It was a joke to say that I would charge another 120 yuan to go to Beijing
such
The farce is over
on the car
I asked a local passenger who is going to Beijing
Fang Zhijie is about 400 kilometers away from Hefei
These vehicles are contracted by the state-owned automobile operation department to individual transporters
and so
They want to join hands
To attract tourists to Beijing with a beautiful tourist bus in Hefei
Transport them to Jieshou
then
Transported from Jieshou to Beijing in an old car
Because there won’t be so many people going to Beijing in Jieshou
Don't cheat
Where does the guest come from
It is said that
At normal price
The bus fare from Hefei to Jieshou is 30 yuan
The bus ticket from Jieshou to Beijing is 100 yuan
such
Passing by that beautiful minibus
Easily cheated 70 yuan from each passenger
5:30 am on the 18th
After we went through endless cold and hunger
Arrived in Fengtai District, Beijing
The flight attendant told us to get off quickly
Otherwise, you will be fined by Beijing law enforcement officers
We want official tickets
The flight attendant said there were no tickets
They constantly urge passengers to get off the bus as soon as possible
Said they must hurry up and earn money during the Spring Festival
Wait for us to get off
The bus then turned around and disappeared into the misty sky

Poor mothers account for more than 15 million
They are the most vulnerable
The most difficult group
Rescued poor mothers
Their children and family will be the beneficiaries

Then cut out taxes and so on
Donation for the charity sale is about 500,000 yuan, right?
I ask:

Kabul Orphanage-A Trip to Afghanistan III
Our reporter in Pakistan Wang Nan
There is an orphanage in the west of Kabul
Sheltering many orphans who have lost their parents and relatives
They are waiting to be fed
Miserable situation
Sympathetic and pitiful
This orphanage
Not small
A building and a square surrounded by a wall
But the walls and buildings are old
Looks black and gray
A gloomy morning
The reporter visited the Kacheng Orphanage
Enter the gate
Surrounded by orphans inside
They are malnourished
Skinny
His body is much thinner than his actual age
Look at their messy hair
Dirty face
Neck and small hands
And clothes with heavy dirt
It’s not hard to imagine how long they haven’t bathed
How long have their clothes changed
Walk into a dark gray building
This is the main place where the orphans live
Through the dim corridor
aisle
Came to a staff's office
Found that the windows inside are not glass
But covered with plastic sheet
The dean hadn't arrived yet
A teacher named Wari received the reporter
This orphanage has existed for a long time
How many years have it been? Even Warri can’t tell.
More than 600 orphans have been accommodated now
The oldest has grown up
The youngest is only 1 year old
More than 40 staff
Including 6 teachers
Food for orphans
Medicines mainly come from the assistance of international organizations
But the number is limited
Orphans often don't have enough food
Staff salaries are provided by local authorities
Very meager
Per capita monthly income converted into RMB is less than 30 yuan
The conditions and facilities of the orphanage are very simple
More than 600 orphans all crowded in 20 rooms
An average of 30 people live in each room
The room is full of bunk beds
There are many different kinds of bedding on the bed
No heating equipment
Although there are lights
But often power outages
The dining room for orphans is poor and small
There is a long slat in the middle that is slightly higher than the ground
There are long slats that are slightly lower on each side
This is the dining table and stool
And can only accommodate up to 100 people
So every meal orphans are divided into 6 batches

He strongly hopes
The world can pay attention to the fate of these orphans
About to leave the orphanage
The reporter took out two pairs of domestic panda toys prepared in advance
5 packets of chocolate candies and 4 packets of biscuits
And 1 Pakistani banknote with a denomination of 1,000 rupees

Please accept the heart of a Chinese
The dean was moved speechlessly
But the other staff present thanked everyone
When leaving
It's raining
The staff of the orphanage and the orphans stood in the rain and waved to each other
A little boy named Mulla was among them
He just turned 10 this year
My parents died in an air strike in the civil war not long ago
In Afghanistan
Similar tragedies continue

Let the lake sparkle-Malawi Trip 3 (1 photo attached)
Wen Xian, our reporter in South Africa
The picture shows the government office building in Lilongwe, the capital of Malawi
(Photo by our reporter Wen Xian)
The breathtaking Great Rift Valley lies across the northern part of Malawi, which is shaped like a sharp sword.
To the south stands the 3,000-meter-high Meilanjie Peak
But chat with any Malawian
They said in unison that the most boastful thing about this country is of course Lake Malawi.
The majestic and beautiful Lake Malawi is an invaluable treasure given to the people of Malawi by nature
This one is 580 kilometers long
The eleventh largest lake in the world and the third largest lake in Africa, which are 80 kilometers wide, account for about 2% of the country’s land area.
There are more than 500 species of fish in the Great Lakes
Many of these species are unique to Lake Malawi
So far
Lake Malawi has not yet been polluted by industry
Under the clear sky
The lake is clear and vast
Refreshing
Malawi Ministry of Tourism officials said
If the African continent is personified
Malawi is in the heart
In addition, the people of Malawi are extremely simple
friendly
Peaceful
then
The slogan of the Malawi Tourism Department to promote its own to the world is
Malawi——A warm heart in Africa
however
There are many restrictive factors in the tourism development of Lake Malawi
The first is the road conditions
When driving from the capital Lilongwe to the lakeside town of Salima
There are bumps on the road less than 100 kilometers
It's raining again
It makes people sigh that the road is hard to walk from time to time
Head south from Salima to the famous lakeside resort
Monkey Bay
Time
The last 70 kilometers was completely bumped over in muddy pits.
How can such a transportation infrastructure attract more tourists?
Another serious shortcoming is the lack of accommodation facilities
The number of beds in hotels in Malawi is now less than 1,000
There are only about 200 beds in the hotel by the lake in Malawi
In 25 hotels nationwide
Few hotels that exceed the international standard three-star service level
Soon after the new government of Malawi was established
The Ministry of Tourism was formed for the first time
In the past two years
The newly established Ministry of Tourism first formulated policies and blueprints for vigorously developing tourism:
The previous government not only stipulated that Malawian women must wear knee-length skirts
No long pants or short skirts
And the requirement of foreign women is no exception
This scares many people who want to travel to Malawi
The new government broke this stereotype
Extend your hands to all visitors to welcome
Comprehensive improvement of roads in 5 national parks including Lake Malawi
Communication
Accommodation and other infrastructure
In addition to preparing to build new hotels in some tourist resorts
The original major hotels across the country have now been handed over to South Africa’s Puotti Hotel Group for management
Despite facing fierce competition in the tourism industry of neighboring countries
The Malawi government still plans to attract 350,000 tourists per year until 2000
Make Malawi tourism the second largest foreign exchange earning industry after the tobacco industry
In fact
Malawi is already attracting more and more people to visit this once extremely closed country
1988
Malawi received less than 100,000 tourists from various countries
This number rose to about 250,000 in 1996
The country of Malawi is named after Lake Malawi
Ravi
It means in the local Chichewa language
Reflected light
Malawi means the sun shining on the lake and reflecting like flames
just now
Malawians are striving to make the Malawi lake shine like flames

On the streets of Johannesburg
Memorial wall
(1 picture attached)
Wen Xian
Since May this year
An unusual aspect appeared on the streets of Johannesburg
Memorial wall
Memorial wall
Located at the intersection of Jan Smartz Street and Empel Street, the main road into Joburg
This was originally a very ordinary retaining wall facing the street
It was once covered with various advertisements and graffiti
Now it becomes a picture full of solemnity
An even more heavy picture scroll: The 77-meter-long wall is painted with different colors full of large and small heads
They are all this
Murder capital
Victims of the crime wave
The date they were killed is marked under each avatar
Can't hide their nostalgia for this world
Every avatar is watching the sunrise and sunset of Johannesburg with open eyes
The faces of most avatars still have beautiful smiles
That sunday morning
The streets of Johannesburg are as quiet as if they have not yet woken up from their sleep
I came alone
Memorial wall
before
Staring at each head again and again
Savour the thousands of words revealed in the eyes
Some of them rushed into Johannesburg along this street just two or three months ago.
97 avatars with 97 different stories
The longest of them is 82 years old
The youngest is only 5 years old
Among them are white
There are black people
There are also Chinese
There are South Africans
There are also foreigners
There is a doctor among them
businessman
student
The police and the naive child
Their backgrounds are so different
But also victims of social crime
Hughes, 82, was a celebrity in South Africa’s sports
In 1939, he led the South African national football team to fight on the green field of the British Isles three times
Criminals don’t care how glorious your history is
In a house robbery that happened last year
Hughes fell under the gun of the criminal
The 61-year-old Besseheim is a leading economist in South Africa
Was killed in an armed robbery on May 1 this year
Before this
He has experienced similar robberies three times
The killing of Besseheim caused great shock in South African business circles
A 75-year-old woman, Burns, was killed by a criminal after she was raped when she was writing Christmas cards to overseas friends at home on November 3 last year.
Was thrown into the swimming pool in the courtyard
The 5-year-old Ebhim was first beaten with a cricket bat several times by the criminals in the robbery that occurred last year.
Was strangled with a towel
In the afternoon of April 17 this year
Eight armed criminals entered a wholesale store in Johannesburg and robbed
31-year-old Levi was shot and killed by robbers to protect his father
Leve’s misfortune directly led to Joburg
Memorial wall
The advent of
After Levi's death
His friends couldn't bear it
Found the editorial office of The Star
Demand that this brutal criminal act be exposed in some way
As a major newspaper
Daily reports of such crimes can be seen on the "Star" page
And organized public opinion surveys for social crime issues
Many activities including the letter and Chen Yan
This time the editors of The Star had a sudden idea
Came up with the idea of ​​drawing the head of the dead on the wall to alert the government to take effective action against crime
South Africa is a society disturbed by serious social crime problems
This somewhat novel idea came out
And got an immediate response
About 20 students from the Johannesburg Art Foundation gladly picked up paintbrushes
Copy the photos of the victims one by one into big and small heads
Under the writings of these free students
An ordinary street wall turned into a picture with anger
Scroll of sympathy and grief
Many people offered bunches of flowers under this wall
The sentimental elementary and middle school students made many touching poems on this wall
Memorial wall
The birth of has produced an unexpected social shock effect
The planners of the "Star" have continued their efforts
After June of this year, began to organize the painting of the second side of the Fort Joao on the fence of the Baraguana Hospital in Soweto.
Memorial wall
however
South Africa is a bizarre society after all
Just when I visited
Memorial wall
Of the afternoon
Two young people, both 22 years old, came to the wall with oil paint
They painted out some pictures on the wall
I painted a picture and will be held once
Carnival
advertisment
The keyword of the ad is
Enjoy today
Stunned in the face of everyone
The two of them explained
Carnival party will make people more excited
The solemn was teased
"The Star" masterpiece was discounted
The fate of this wall is also in a trance
But after all, it expresses the desire of Joburg people to live in peace
The brave game (1 picture attached)
Zhang Cangji
Acapulco is a beautiful coastal tourist city on the Pacific coast of Mexico.
In Acapulco
Mexican friends said to us
Don't go to Quebrada to watch diving
I have never been to Acapulco
Quebrada
It means cliff in Spanish
The diver has to jump from a 35-meter high cliff into a narrow trench between two cliffs
You can't do without bravery and adventurous spirit
starting time
It's just an adventure game for individual young people
Then it gradually became associated with tourism
Become the city’s most distinctive tourism performance project
It has a history of more than 60 years
The sun goes down
Xi Xi sea breeze blows away the heat of the day
We followed the visitors to the Quebrada cliff stand at the northern end of Acapulco Bay
Looking down from the cliff stand guardrail
There is only a narrow trench between the two cliffs
More than ten meters wide
Only five or six meters narrow
The turbulent water kept rushing between the trenches
The waves beat the cliffs rhythmically
Roar of waves
Dizzying
When night falls
Tourists are already crowded high on the cliff
Low stand
People's eyes are on the opposite cliff
The 6 people performing cliff diving are all about 20 years old
They hold torches
Walk down from us along the stone ladder
Applause and encouragement from the crowd
Go to the bottom stand
They climbed over the guardrail
Down to the bottom of the cliff
Jump into the rapids
Swim bravely to the opposite cliff
After grabbing the raised reef on the opposite bank
They are like antelopes in the mountains
Choosing paths one after another to climb to the top of the 35-meter cliff
As they struggled to climb
We really sweated for them
Although I know they have climbed the cliff many times
But it takes courage to climb the cliff with bare hands without protective measures
After they prayed in front of the Madonna on the top of the cliff
Stand on their own
Jumping platform
on
At this moment, the audience was silent
Some audiences are more nervous than the performers
Almost breathless
Melody starts
They flew up one after another
Jump into the rushing waves one by one
Whenever a performer emerges from the water
The audience sent out at the same time
Bravo
Applause
In less than an hour of performance
Six brave young people performed solo diving for the audience in turn
Double diving and triple diving
The last round is three people diving with torches
They stand on the cliff
Jumping platform
on
Cover your eyes in public with a black cloth
The light goes out
I saw three burning torches on the cliff
When they jumped down
Three torches struck the sky from top to bottom like shooting stars
When the three of them swim out of the water safely
Tourists are relieved again
Thunderous applause and cheers
Some people might think
High divers only need to be bold and careful
You can try your skills here
actually not
Quebrada cliffs are steep
But not against the sea
Performers cannot jump vertically
And must fly out
Avoid clear rocks and reefs by the trench
Otherwise it will be broken
therefore
The Mexicans call the Acapulco cliff diving
Death diving
The show is over
Tourists are not in a hurry to leave
They have to wait for the brave youth to come ashore
Hug and take a photo with them
Acapulco has blue waters
Soft sand
Bright sun
Verdant Coconut Grove
There are gorgeous and picturesque tropical scenery
But only its cliff jump is unforgettable
The mountains cover the water

Montreal is on a maple-flowered ingot island between the St. Lawrence River and its tributary Ottawa River
Viewed from the Shunjac Cartier Bridge on St. Helens Island in the St. Lawrence River
It can be seen that the sea-blue surging torrents flow over a mountain that suddenly rises from the wild
1535 years
The French explorer Jacques Cartier sailed here
Call it
Huashan
Then got the current name
Montreal
Mongolia extends from Mount Hua
Expanded by an Iroquois village from earlier Indians
Developed into the most prosperous modern metropolis in Canada today
Chinese in North America call it
Montreal
Here
The ancient traditions of Europa coexist with the post-modernization of the New World
Shows a clear contrast of European and American style
on the one hand
The ancient city of Mongolia was originally from France
New building owner
Paul Chaumaud built in the footsteps of Cartier under the Huashan slope
Ceded to the British royal family
Has always retained the style of the British and French
From the Neo-Gothic Cathedral of Our Lady to the Old Port
On the stone road in the streets
The open-top four-wheeled carriage bumped past the secluded windows of the stone bases
antique
From time to time I can hear the recitation of Handel's "Messiah"
Huashan Saint Joseph's Chapel
From time to time there are pilgrims kneeling with their legs
Lap up
Pray for blessing
Bystanders also seem to be free from dust
Into the quiet world
the other side
Mongolian City is a scene of consumer society
Since the first 45-story skyscraper in the 1960s
Reinforced glass towers are springing up like mushrooms
Modern like Manhattan, New York
Modern building
The most abrupt is the Leaning Tower of Montreal built during the 1976 Olympics
Everyone knows the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Italy
Ke Yi Guo Tower tilts only 5 degrees
And the Montreal Tower is 175 meters high
Tilted 45 degrees
Amazing
Attract millions of people to visit
Another wonder
It's a large floating crystal ball in St Helens Island Park
Name

The U.S. Pavilion where the World Expo was originally held
Later preserved as a memorial
Because it stands out
Extraordinarily noticeable
Not far from here
Standing Alexander Calder's sculpture "Man"
Famous broadcast
Conceivable abstraction
Not humanoid
Make people think
The twin sister of St. Helens Island is Notre Dame Island
Montreal Casino
Originally the French Pavilion at the World Expo
Equipped with 1,500 slot machines and 86 gaming tables
Roulette starts from 11 am to 3 pm daily
Ball betting and card betting
Its madness is no less than Las Vegas in the United States
Walk through at night
The author observes the complicated gambling game and the sudden change of hot and cold gambler attitude
It's hard to find out what the pain and happiness are
I am puzzled by the unique rural natural scenery of Mongolia
Why people squeeze into this hustle and bustle
The big hive that is so stuffy
65% of the residents of Montgomery are Quebecers
Always speak french
18% speak English
There are still 80 ethnic groups mixed
Makes this a multi-skinned international city
Mr. Antonio, a local of Italian descent, accompanied me out of the casino
Talking on the way back
As for Quebec
They are descendants of the French nation
Facing American cultural influence
What this ethnic group generally cares about is how to maintain their cultural identity
of course
This is the principle state policy of Canada
Jumon City for months
A glance
It is the competition and integration of different national cultures
Full of tradition and fashion
Natural and artificial
The contradiction between entry and birth
The conflict between faith and freedom
Reflected in the diversity of urban architectural styles and residents’ lifestyles and the search for future balance and harmony
or
It is this kind of collision and communication
Full of vitality and vitality to the whole land covered with ice and snow for several months
Danni Liqun Rice Floral
Jun
August
It is the early spring season in the southern hemisphere
We were invited to the Australian mainland city of Danieliquin to participate in an event commemorating the 200th anniversary of the introduction of Merino sheep
This city, 1,000 kilometers west of Sydney, is actually just a small town
Population less than 10,000
But because it is the birthplace of the Merino sheep
Has made a decisive contribution to Australia's economic development
So it is quite famous in Australia
Our host enthusiastically introduced us to the process of merino breeding
Led us to a beautiful and rich pasture
He also made an exception to show us Australia raised in a secret pen
national treasure
———Merino Breeding Sheep
Just when we are going home
The enthusiastic host stopped and said:
Don't worry
Halfway through the tour
Next we want to show you our newly built rice farm
The one who drives and acts as a guide for us is a rice farmer
His name is Randall
Looks more than 60 years old
But the body is tough
He held the steering wheel with one hand
Introduce us with one hand
He called himself an old friend of China
Because he has visited China once a year since 1992
Mainly to participate in the Beijing International Senior Tennis Championships
Visit in China by the way
Maybe the inspiration from China played a role
In recent years, he changed 1/4 of his farm to plant rice
of course
The real reason is
Although they have the best sheep breed in the world
But due to unstable wool prices in the international market
Poor market
Australia's wool industry has been hit hard
Ranchers have found another way
The way out Randall was to plant rice
The off-road vehicle driven by Randall took us to a rice field near a clear stream
Endless
But on a very level land
Each paddy field surrounded by ridges has at least dozens of hectares
Randall explained
They have excellent conditions for growing rice here
One is ground level
There is almost no big ups and downs in a radius of several hundred kilometers
It is said to be the largest flat area on the earth
The second is water
The rainwater on the nearby mountains is collected by a river named Edward River
Flow through here
In addition
The groundwater here is also abundant
Can dig a well
Look around
We saw a giant tractor pulling a bucket-like machine working in the distance near the horizon
Randall says
That is a laser grader
They rely on this advanced machine to level the ground
Because of the good benefits of growing rice
He plans to expand the paddy field again this year
Randall’s rice farm now has 2,000 hectares
But there are only 3 daily staff
Which also includes himself
In busy hours
They hire some temporary workers
Such a big rice field
What to do when planting seedlings
We ask
The answer is: we use the live broadcast method
After the land is leveled
Irrigate water every October
Then use a small plane to sow
Use airplanes for fertilizer
When harvesting in March
Giant Combein
The rice scattered in the ground after the rough harvest is not wasted
They will bring cattle and sheep to eat
Even though the live broadcast method is used
Rice yield is not bad
Up to 700 kilograms per mu
Are there any pests and diseases here
The answer is: because it is a new rice field
No pests have been found
The most troublesome is the wild duck
Whenever the rice heading season
Thousands of wild ducks will fly to peck
If the measures are not effective
May lose everything
In Australia
The law prohibits people from shooting wild animals
But they get permission from the government to shoot
however
They still use laser simulation flash guns more
The effect is good
About four weeks
They are the most nervous
Because Danieliquin’s farmers are good at introducing and cultivating high-quality rice
The rice produced here is glutinous and fragrant
Very popular in foreign markets
last year
The annual output of rice in this area has exceeded one million tons
Mainly exported to Japan
Indonesia and South Pacific Islands
Even with
Kangaroo
'S trademark hits a Chinese supermarket
The current export price of Australian rice has reached around US$600 per ton
1.5 times the export price of wheat
Therefore, farmers’ enthusiasm for planting rice is unprecedentedly high
Parting
Randall said meaningfully to us:
Someday
Daniele Quinn may once again contribute to Australia with its high-quality rice
Diana and the stars
Vegetation
End of August
Diana in the UK had a car accident
Dying
Foreign and domestic major newspapers and tabloids raged for a while
Literally
Destroy Paris
Fragrant Xiaoyu
It's not strange

The final ending is naturally going to be a big fuss
Somewhat wondering
It’s the grief of the British people
Still offering flowers after many days
There is no shortage of donations
Even had
Princess of the people
Said
Hold it down more seriously
This former princess can’t say anything
Or for the country and the people
contribution
Don’t talk about falling in love with a guard or a wealthy dude, etc.
Just talk about her noblest charity event
Actually everyone understands
People in high positions or with huge wealth show up at such events from time to time.
Public relations practice
It may not be able to prove personality or guarantee the effectiveness of poverty alleviation
Maybe it's not bad
investment
In short
There is probably a qualitative difference between the kind deeds of the former princess and the physical work of Mother Teresa who also died recently.
Even if it is praiseworthy
It doesn’t seem to make millions of people stand on the streets
The leaders of the government and churches have come forward to give the highest level of praise and memory
When I saw Diana’s funeral on TV
A thought flashed in my mind: how many of these many mourners have and will still enthusiastically buy a newspaper that publishes secrets about Diana’s private life
One of the reasons for the car accident was a sneak shot for the news media
The reporter who took photos chased and intercepted Diana
And the one who missed her most energetically and the one who was most enthusiastic about reading the boring newspapers that drove her to death
I'm afraid it's the same group of people
Diana is indeed not a hero or a great man in the traditional sense
Not even the old-style royal nobility
She is a superstar in this modern consumer society

Has a lot of obsessive audience
Elvis
Priestley
Michael Jackson and even Madonnas
In a sense
Diana was loved precisely because she did not accomplish anything
Because she is no greater than us except for her radiant appearance
Higher or more knowledgeable
She is one of our consumers
It just reflects people’s similar desires more intensively—from her mythical marriage that looked like Cinderella at one time to her leading trend of beautiful costumes
Even her family turmoil brought her close to the experience of ordinary people
The public can't wait to explore the privacy of stars
Seems to see an enlarged
beautify
My own
Even in our country where the market economy has not yet fully developed
Film and television celebrities large and small are also writing
pass
Tell personal experience
It can be seen that this kind of demand is everywhere
Ascendant
Diana
Whether she consciously or not at first
At least after becoming the princess, he readily accepted
Celebrity
Of the role of
A person has been living under the spotlight for nearly twenty years
It's impossible without my cooperation
It can be said
Star Diana
Is the media
Shaped by the public and herself
thus
In the tragic ending of being chased by reporters to a car accident
As a star being chased
Diana is not only a victim
Collusion in a sense
If you only look at it from this perspective (the driver’s story involves another long list of social life issues)
Another person responsible for the accident is through the media
consumption
Diana's passionate star fans
But the public cannot offend
and so
What we see is
Britain’s prime minister and archbishop followed suit
Show that they are connected with the people
As for the British royal family
They received a huge salary for nothing
But failed to serve as the national public relations director as competently as Diana
I don’t want to star in a live series.
Royal grudge
Show everyone
Now it is facing tremendous pressure from public opinion
Diana's tragedy triggered condemnation and reflection on the media
But I haven’t seen anyone questioning the public rightly
Right to know

then
After people gritted their teeth and scolded reporters for sneak shots
Just go to watch Diana’s grand funeral and continue to appreciate the biography and anecdotes about her
As a name
God
Of consumers
We still have this privilege
and
We really don’t bother to ask ourselves those horrible questions: for example
Diana (or other similar stars) who has been very lively for more than a decade
Hype
in
What did we get
Is this tragedy also a public tragedy in the final analysis?
Zarina
Yin Shuguang
Zarina is a lovely Uzbek girl
Fair complexion
A pair of eyes are as clear as water
In Samarkand
Oriental Melody
Rehearsal for the opening ceremony of the International Music Festival
I got to know her
then
Waiting
catwalk
There was a commotion among the lads of the Chinese Central National Orchestra
I followed everyone's eyes
I saw it on the terrace of the Great Mosque opposite
A young girl in a gorgeous national costume is waving here frequently
She in the distance is like a fairy
Like a bunch of fluttering red silk
No wonder lads
Chaos
What
She is Zarina
An innocent girl who dances at the music festival
After hitting this
She seems to have forged an indissoluble bond with Chinese actors
Every performance
We can all enjoy the graceful dance of the girl whirling
Zarina is 17 years old this year
Samarkand Medical School is now in third grade
It's a girl after all
Chat with the dancer
Her face smiled like a blooming flower
Say that you can meet a lot of friends
No need to go to the countryside to pick cotton like other students
Uzbekistan is a major cotton producer in the world
Annual output of lint is about 4 million tons
When cotton is harvested in autumn
Nationwide mobilization here
The students’ daily cotton collection quota is 40 kg
Get paid for completing tasks
Chatting
Our conversation gradually became heavier somehow
I never thought
She seems carefree
Actually like us adults
Also have their own depression
Surrounded by the harsh reality of life
original
Since childhood
Zarina dreamed of being a movie actor
Not long ago
The director of the Tashkent Film Studio took her
And invited her to take samples there
But Zarina's father said:
It's embarrassing for a girl to be an actor
Staying at home well is the right way
When saying these things
Zarina's innocent face seemed to be shrouded in dark clouds
Looks extremely dissonant
There was a silence between us
History is often surprisingly similar
Zarina told me
Grandma was very beautiful when she was young
I also dream of going to the screen
Also met with firm opposition from parents
Early this century
Grandma still needs a veil on her head when she goes out
But grandma is a thoughtful
A woman with personality
In pursuit of dreams
She ran away from home
But in the end it was still
collar
Coming home
later
A girlfriend of her grandma who also ran away from home became a famous movie star
Every time grandma mentions
Can't help but sigh
Zarina's father is highly educated
Now serving in local government agencies
Mother is a teacher at university
Look at her helpless
I suddenly came up with an idea
You can ask grandma to help
Let her convince dad
The son will listen to his mother
Don't wait for me to finish
She shook her head disappointedly
Whispered:
It would be fine if grandma was alive
It's a pity she is gone
Before the October Revolution
Islam has a great influence in Central Asia
After the establishment of Soviet power
Islamic influence is greatly limited
But after the collapse of the Soviet Union
Traditional religious thoughts are on the rise again
Yu Jin
In the Fergana Basin
Some men have big beards like their grandparents
More and more people began to pray in the direction of Mecca five times a day
Zarina doesn't blame others
On the contrary, he is very considerate of dad's difficulties
She said seriously
If she becomes an actress
Colleagues in my father’s work would gossip
Thought his daughter could not find another job
actor
of
Dad can't hold his head up
Zarina also told me
She came home late these days
The neighbor next door is already chewing his tongue
Looking at the little girl in the cardamom years before her
I can’t calm down: Did God deliberately let a young mind carry such a heavy load
Return from this interview
I often think in random ways: If Zarina ran away from home like her grandma did
What is waiting for her
perhaps
She will be like thousands of Uzbek women tomorrow
Parenting
Waiting for in-laws
Children and grandchildren
When one day
I stepped into this ancient Silk Road city again
Can you still find the clear and watery eyes of the girl Zarina
Gorky Street Today
Xie Hong Yupeng
Moscow’s Gorky Street may be the place where people can feel the changes in the past and the past.
Gorky Street (now renamed Tverskaya Street) is one of the main streets in Moscow
It is also the oldest street in Moscow
It has a history of more than 600 years so far
It is a beautiful and luxurious store
Proud of hotels and various famous cultural facilities
There are many shops on both sides of the street
More than half of the famous theaters and museums in the city are concentrated on this street
There are also different styles of Russian architecture
Various people and different scenes
Since Russia introduced a market economy
Here has lost its old simplicity and elegance
Become more commercial
Walk into Gorky Street
You will feel that you are not on Russian soil
Because there are billboards of foreign manufacturers on both sides of the street: Pioneer Audio
Philips Electric
McDonald's fast food and more
Too many to list
These billboards are all in English and Latin
What broker
Marketing
Open the door
close the door
Shop size
boss
Parking lot etc.

If you only understand Russian,
But not English
That is simply
Grandma Liu enters the Grand View Garden-at a loss
There are countless banks and currency exchange offices on both sides of Gorky Street
It seems that all the people who come here are rich people waiting to open an account
The miraculously preserved Ostrovsky Museum’s roof is also hung with a sign of the 24-hour foreign currency exchange
If you walk the whole street
You will meet dozens of Coca-Cola ads
More than a dozen Pepsi ads
More than a dozen advertisements for German and Austrian beer and Weishi cigarettes
5 advertisements to promote Marlboro and Jian cigarettes
The shop here is unique
Each has its own style
The gift shop with a festive atmosphere attracts a large number of customers every day
Elegant fragrance from the cosmetics store
Refreshing
Optional supermarket bustling
Business is booming
The food shop is famous for its exquisite food
It can be said that the items here are everything
It's just that the price is staggering
A toy dog ​​here also costs 48,000 rubles (about 10 dollars)
75 thousand rubles per kilogram of salmon
The eel is 125,000 rubles per kilogram
The Friendship Bookstore that used to sell books from socialist countries
Now it has been changed into a car exhibition hall
Rolls Royce on display here
Chevrolet
Cadillac
Toyota and other cars
One is more luxurious than the other
The old Tchaikovsky Concert Hall has been changed to a grand hotel
Everything in the hotel is imported from Austria
The general working class dare not care
And in the food store
You have the feeling of being in the World Food Museum
Here can help you familiarize yourself with famous brand products from all over the world
Here are Swiss chocolates
Spanish fruit candy
Chinese cookies
Finnish coffee
Danish cake
Polish pork
French ham
Croatian Waffles
British tea, etc.
On today’s Gorky Street, I’m afraid that only the roses sold by the old lady and the fish pies sold by a group of teenagers in yellow clothes are pure Russian products.
Although there are many fast food restaurants here
Plus foreign impact
But pure Russian fish pies still sell well
Because only it really has an appetite for Russians
If you have the opportunity to go to Gorky Street in Moscow
Do not forget to bring money
Because you will find children in front of you who collect donations from pedestrians for church repairs
There are street performers behind you, please give me some money
On your left there are a few ragged beggars begging you
There are some old ladies on your right to sell you cheap small Russian daily necessities
If you don't have money
Embarrass yourself
Rare
rigid
Xing Shijia
German dumb
Before visiting Germany
Many people who have been to Germany told me like this
but
When I was in Germany to feel their dullness
Found this
rigid
Rigorous
pragmatic
Persistent spirit
And this is precisely what some Chinese lack
rigorous
pragmatic
Persistence is the consistent work style of Germans
Stressing efficiency is the principle of the Germans
We also advocate this
But in many cases just stay on the oral and textbook
Because many people have not formed this inner norm
And this kind of thing is permeated in the bones and subconsciousness of Germans
and so
No need to preach
No need to remind
Germans build high efficiency on a rigorous foundation
they think
High efficiency without rigor
Destined to be short-lived efficiency
The result can only be half the effort
a waste of resource
During the expedition in Germany
We saw along the way
The paving workers here have to lean down when paving the road
Pick up the stones one by one
One section per shop
Put your face close to the road and check whether the paved road is smooth
Such a rigorous work attitude
Really amazed us all
The Germans are confident that there will be no shaking and bumps in the car here
Confident that their cars can travel long distances without problems
of course
This confident capital is not just the excellence of German automakers
It also comes from the rigorous labor of paving workers
Road construction
Such work as municipal construction is definitely regarded as an eternal career
Quality always comes first
Every stone and brick must be placed in the most suitable position
Never careless
They set a record of not having a house collapsed due to construction quality problems in 20 years
Seeing flowers in 6 cities in Germany
Visited nearly 20 units
A tense and serious working atmosphere can be felt everywhere
There are no idlers here or playing jokes
All I see is that employees strictly guard their posts

All you hear is the knock of the keyboard and the roar of the machine
We found in some shopping malls and hotels
These units employ very few people

They employ only one-fourth of China's
Multiple posts are very common in the German service industry
German buses except for strikes
Are strictly punctual
The bus stop sign indicates what time to arrive at a certain station
The car will arrive as scheduled, neither early nor late
During Germany
There were two car drivers driving for us
Although German law requires
The driver shall not work continuously for more than 6 hours a day
But our two drivers often work more than 8 hours a day
And every time you start from a place
The drivers came to the parking lot to wait for us
It's never been a minute late
This is the German
rigid
I think
The reason why the German economy is strong
Largely because of the rigor of the Germans
Pragmatic
rigid
style
And this has become the personality psychology of the Germanic nation
Picasso House
Huang Xuefeng
In a sunny day
Bathed in the autumn breeze from the Mediterranean
We were accompanied by Mr. Montoya to visit Picasso’s old house in Barcelona
Picasso’s old house is located in an alley on Francas Street in Barcelona
It is now the Picasso Museum
This is a typical Catalan house
The architecture and decoration style of the house is no different from the surrounding houses
Walk into this two-story brick-wood structure
Suddenly a 123 square meter patio appeared in front of me
Several pots of Picasso’s favorite lilies were placed in the courtyard
Begonia and roses
Two wicker chairs are placed next to the flowerpot
After Picasso painted
Often sit here to watch flowers and plants or chat with visitors
Picasso lived in this old residence for nearly 40 years
He died at the age of 92 in 1973
Now people go to empty chairs
Can't help but see things and think about people
It is regrettable
After Picasso’s old house was converted into a museum
All changes to the layout of the building
The living room in the original building
living room
The study and the studio are completely different
All rooms upstairs and downstairs are opened
Become 16 interlinked exhibition rooms
Exhibiting the representative works of Picasso in various periods
Picasso was born in Malaga, southern Spain in 1881
Father is a painter
He was aware of his son's artistic talent by his instinct
He encouraged Picasso to go to Barcelona and Madrid to study fine art
Picasso really lived up to his father's expectations
He became famous when he was only 15 years old with "The First Communion Ceremony"
The first 6 rooms show Picasso’s early works
Divided into
Blue period
with
Rose red period
Among them, "The Two Sisters"
"Embrace" and other works are full of sad blue tones
Those depicting circus actors and street performers such as "Actors Rest"
"Jianghu Artists" and others present romantic and frivolous rose red warm colors
Many people gathered in front of the painting "The Girl of Ajon"
There are still some people sitting underground copying
The five naked girls on this painting and their backgrounds are all made up of geometric blocks
This painting was created in 1907
At that time Picasso was studying African primitive carving art with great concentration
And get new artistic inspiration from it
Pioneered Cubism
The largest oil painting in the museum is "Guernica"
But here is a copy
The original is in the National Museum of Madrid
This painting is Picasso’s most famous painting with cubism
Abstract painting combining realism and surrealism
The picture is obscure
After the commentator explained, we learned
The painting is based on the German bombing of Guernica in northern Spain during World War II.
Angrily condemned the fascist barbaric war crimes
Many pottery and sculptures made by Picasso are also exhibited here
Most shapes are abstract
Expressed Picasso's many complex emotions
Standing on these with severe deformation
Distorted and exaggerated brushstrokes and a large number of works piled up by geometric color blocks
I deeply feel that the life of an artist has already surpassed the physical limit
It seems that the master is still painting in his big studio
Still screaming:
Give up creation
Is tantamount to giving up life
The simple old-fashioned chandelier in the corridor gleamed dimly
A bronze bust of Picasso sits on a black marble base at the exit downstairs
He frowned and looked forward
What was he thinking about
What to see
He is still thinking about his artistic creation
Out of the museum
Strolling in the alleys where Picasso walked
Look back
Then build it with cement and stones
Old house without any decoration
Look simple and solemn in the sunset
Winter trip to Hokkaido

Winter trip to Hokkaido
Don't have a taste
Out of Hakodate Airport
Bai Xue dazzling
Chilly
But not piercing
en route
I saw the same roof
About 70 degrees
It is said that
There is no snow on this slope
Look along the way
Although the ground is still snowy
The roof is really dry
Hokkaido's climate is changeable
The sun was shining 10 minutes ago
But now a lot of snow falls

We arrived at the main attraction of this trip: Sapporo Snow Country Temple Fair
Snow on the main road
Most ice sculptures are world famous buildings
Statue of Liberty
Egyptian Pyramids
Arc de Triomphe, France, etc.
The sculptures surrounding the main road are people and animals
Torajiro miss you
Is one of them
In terms of carving level
general
There are two things that are noticeable on the move
One is one

Passing by the Japanese one by one stopped and raised their wrists
The organizer is a 50 or 60 year old elder
Distribute and return promotional materials to pedestrians on the four northern islands
The second is a young woman named Sato
A special bed resting on the ice and snow
She is lying on the bed
The metal frame of the artificial respirator is supported by the bed
A young face is exposed outside the thick quilt
Two young men raised a donation box to raise money for her
Donors get a piece of Sato’s medical history and struggle history
10 years old Sato suffers from spinal muscular atrophy
Difficulty breathing
Since then I have been breathing with artificial respirators
April 1990

She and her partner used the Snow Country Temple Fair to hope to get help from everyone
Out of the temple fair
Dine in a tourist restaurant
300 people dining
Only listen to the sound of food
Unheard
After meal
Qiben Big Bus
Several ups and downs on the way
I never lost a minute waiting for someone
From here to Hakodate
Nearly 4 hours travel
At this moment
The tour guide is here
She first asked the guests to guess the riddle
There are 7 questions
Like Hokkaido or Kyushu, who is bigger
Is wicker fish a specialty of Hokkaido?
Next
She sent pen and paper
Ask the traveler to sketch her
The pen has 4 colors
Distribute guests in 4 rows of vertical seats

From the last passenger
Pass forward
3 minutes later
4 sets of sketches were collected into the hands of the tour guide
She laughed
Deliberately let the laughter affect the guests
then
She gave

We show works
After a big laugh
she says:
How do you rate the 4 paintings?
How about this
The mantissa of the car on the opposite side is the score
in a blink
Score announced
Everyone is happy again
then
She also asked passengers to introduce themselves and talk about their impressions of the journey
Time slipped by without knowing it
Time left
She plays a one-man show
Tell history
Scenery
Folklore
Humorous story... along the way
Keep talking
Smile resident
Hakodate night view
First for the church
Russian church
French church
Gothic architecture shines in the lights of thousands of houses
The church is the symbol of Hakodate
Large and small businesses use it as posters
Must pass through an ice and snow corridor in the church
Decorated with hundreds of angel statues
Angels have love proverbs written on them
The form of mutual support and close reading
Has become a big landscape
Maybe
The original intention of the creators is to help each other in the ice and snow
Advise people to cherish each other
Due to climate
After 8 pm
Stores here are basically closed
Finally found a lighted ramen restaurant
Unexpectedly, the store spoke short words
Make people not understand
Insider's explanation: It's the climate
Like meeting acquaintances on the street
Inconvenience Jiuli Snow Greeting
therefore
Hokkaido people use abbreviations indoors and outdoors
Two and a half days journey
The Japanese travel companion hardly said a word to us foreigners
They rarely talk to each other
Heavy walk
Silent view
When breaking up
Bend over and nod
Leave lightly
Comparing people
Get along for two and a half days
I must have made a lot of friends
Have you said a lot of intimate things?
Rainy night
Huang Peizhao
This is two years ago
that time
When I drove to Gaza to go back to Tel Aviv after a business trip
Night begins to fall
It's pouring rain again
Bad thing is
The inside of the windshield is always foggy
Tried every means
Linger
Now it's mixed with rainwater
More vague
Shocking lightning pierced the sky from time to time
Then roll over the rumble of thunder
In such bad weather
Driving a faulty car at night
I can't help but feel uneasy
I hold the steering wheel tightly with both hands
Dare not be a little slack and careless
But i am still in trouble
Due to poor visibility
I finally got the wrong place
Walked into a one-way highway
It's impossible to turn around
How can i return
I am anxious
Just when I can't do anything
Suddenly
Far forward right
There seems to be a faint light flickering
In the dark night around
The light looks very faint
But it makes people feel warm
I was excited
Suddenly speed up
When gradually approaching
I saw that it was an ordinary gas station on the roadside
I drove the car there without thinking
I saw the whole gas station deserted
Not a car to refuel
No one is seen
May have heard the movement
A man came out of a humble hut
Is a lad
Not tall
Dressed casually
Do you want to come on
He has a warm look
Looks like you are cheering me
Look at his friendly attitude
Zhunbao waited for a long time in this dark sky
I hoped that my customer came
But I just refueled the car before I came out of Gaza
It's impossible to add it here
Do not
I'm not cheering
I'm lost
I am embarrassed to tell him the whole story
Thought
He will be disappointed
Can't make money
But ushered in an unprovoked way-seeker
But unexpectedly
Not only did he not ignore
Instead gave me detailed directions
He told me how far I have to go
Where can I go out?
How to go back after going out
Talking
He took out a map
Pointing on it
Gesture
That look worried for me
Makes my heart warm
At last
See me thoroughly understand
He just breathed a sigh of relief
I'm on the road
When I opened the door and got into the car
I have time to wave goodbye to him
He walked at me in the rain
I thought he had something
Open the car window quickly
He looks at me
Say:
It's too dark
It rains so hard again
Look at this energy can't stop for a while
You have to be careful
Open slowly
Don't hurry
Finished
Haven't waited for me to react
He staggered back to the hut
But his words
Still echoing in my ears
And moved me deeply
I never knew him
But he can help me so meticulously and thoughtfully
But me
Misunderstood others at first
I finally returned to the station smoothly
At this moment
Everyone is worrying about me
I will tell you what happened
Everyone says it's a good risk
If it weren’t for this Israeli youth’s enthusiastic help
The consequences are really unimaginable
I couldn't sleep until late
The warm lights and the image of the young man are always shaking before my eyes
To tell the truth
until today
I am still thinking about this young man who cannot be named
My ear
He will often sound his caring words about me
Oh
Memorable dark rainy night
The twinkling lights
Finns celebrate Christmas
Zhang Niansheng
Some people say that Nordic people have a special love for Christmas
This argument is not unreasonable
High latitude here
Long winter and short summer
Especially long nights and short days
The cold and wet winter always gives people a sense of depression
And after the shortest day of December 22
The long winter night will gradually shorten
The sunny days of summer will get closer and closer
So people here are willing to regard Christmas as a turning point in the year
Finns’ expectations for Christmas are typical in Northern Europe
Legend has it that Santa Claus came from the village of Rovaniemi in northern Finland
November 30 this year
The fourth Sunday before Christmas
It’s the day of Jesus’ coming
The national Christmas season in Finland begins on this day
Every family starts to light Christmas candles
The traditional custom is to light a candle every Sunday from now on
Nowadays, sharp-angled candle lights are often placed at home
When walking through the streets
Candle-shaped lamps can be seen everywhere on the windowsills of various houses
The weak red light is soft and warm
And the shadow of the street corners constitute a unique mystery and tranquility
Pietalsaari, a small town on the west coast of Finland
There is a unique Christmas street
Since 1840
This sunday every year
This street is always brightly lit
The cross erected on the street
The three signs of anchor and heart are brightly illuminated
These three signs represent trust
Hope and love
It's people's beautiful longing
This street used to be lit by real candles
Although candles have been replaced by candle-shaped electric lights
But this ancient custom has been passed down
Every year, many winter tourists come here to stop and wander
Noon on December 24
Held in Turku, the old capital of Finland
Peace christmas
Celebration ceremony
Is an important national event on Christmas Eve
Most Finns turn on the radio on time at 12 o'clock to listen to the ceremony
It marks the true beginning of Christmas
Another important activity of this day is going to church
The churches in many towns opened at 6 o'clock that morning
People go to church to pray
Second, relatives and friends who died for sacrifice
Many Finns think that paying homage to the deceased is the most serious thing at Christmas
Never perfunctory
People lit candles in front of tombstones in the churchyard
When night falls
The red candlelight swayed in the white snow
Solemn
Any passerby will be infected
In many small towns
The veterans never forget to go to the tomb of the martyrs
Light a candle for the former comrades in arms
Let them also share the warmth of holiday gathering
And in the capital Helsinki
Many representatives of social organizations and military officers will go to the tomb of the founding father of Marshal Maneheim to pay their respects
To express his infinite respect
Unlike most countries,
Finnish families always have Santa Claus visiting on Christmas Eve
This Santa Claus may be played by his father
Or by a neighbor
When Santa Claus dressed up carries a gift bag on his shoulder
When the crutch appears
His first sentence is
Are there any good kids here
The answer is always
Have
Then the children sang to Santa
Santa Claus stays soon
Wait for the children to sing the last song and leave
Let the children who have been looking forward to the holiday have more time to share the joy of getting gifts
Eat next
New Year's Eve Dinner
Up
This is the most hearty meal at home in the year
Housewives often have to work for several days
Finished
New Year's Eve Dinner
Many Finns never forget to soak in the sauna for a while
If one day has the opportunity to travel to the Finnish countryside
You will find that almost every household’s sauna is steaming
That may be the unique landscape of Finland
Finns love saunas
Many social activities are inseparable from the sauna
Like making friends
Business talk
And take a sauna on Christmas Eve
It also seems to have a special meaning: let the high temperature of 90 degrees Celsius eliminate the unhappiness and unhappiness accumulated on the body over the past year
Evaporates through sweat
Wishing good luck for the coming year
Feeling of loneliness
Yang Rusheng
recent
I read a report from French publications: An old woman widowed lives in an apartment building in Paris
Alone
With a dog
One day and night
The old man died suddenly of a heart attack
No one found
Old woman died
Two big dogs nobody feeds
To satisfy your hunger with the master's body
after a few days
food
Exhausted
Ergou began to scream at the door
Alarm neighbors
People found this tragedy...
The author lived in France for two years
Although I have never seen such tragedies
But those tremblingly walking the streets
The image of the old man living in the home is still vivid
At the time I lived in an apartment building on the edge of Paris
More than a dozen households in the neighborhood are lonely old people
The most pitiful are those single elderly women
The end of the year before
I ran into an old lady living on the 8th floor in the elevator
Not seen for many days
I knew she had eye disease
And was hospitalized for surgery
She should have taken the stitches those days
Because of the strike
All buses are suspended
It's hard to find a taxi
Old man anxious
Groaning
After listening to her
I promised to drive her to the hospital
Back from the hospital
The old man took my hand
Gratitude is beyond words
Have to buy me champagne
Single old people like this
It is said that there are hundreds of thousands in Paris
Compared to many people
She is still lucky
Have housing
Have social insurance
Also have children and sisters
And those old people who sleep in the subway or in front of the corridor
The situation is miserable
They freeze to death on the streets every winter
Ms. Gao is a French Chinese painter
Held a Chinese painting class at home
More than a dozen students are almost all elderly
Some come from afar
They came to learn painting
Except out of admiration for Chinese culture
Another important reason is to resolve the loneliness in my heart

Unavoidably asking for directions
If you run into an elderly person
The enthusiasm is really moving
Some will accompany you for a while
A
Old paris
say to me
These old people can't find a chance to talk all day long
I met one by chance, of course I wouldn't let it go easily
France is like many western countries
Facing the serious challenge of an aging population
According to a 1996 survey by the French Statistical and Economic Research Center
People over 60 years old account for 23% of the total French population
10 years ago, it was only 18.4%
In 1987, people over 65 accounted for 13.3%
And now it has reached 16%
Into old age
This is a major turning point in life
Is also the final stage of the journey of life
They need to interact with people
Hope to enjoy the family affection and warmth
In a society like France
Because it has a relatively solid material foundation and a complete social security system
For most elderly
There is no problem with their food and clothing
The greatest pain is the loneliness in life
Among the elderly over 60
Two-thirds no longer live in their relatives and friends
3/4 of the people do not participate in group activities
Most elderly people live a life of isolation
Another survey report showed
The most unfortunate is an old woman over 80 who is mostly widowed
Because women’s pensions are usually about 40% lower than men’s
The income of these old women has dropped drastically after being widowed
One-fourth of old women over 80 have never worked
No pension at all
Their situation is even more miserable
someone said
Western society is
Children's paradise
Old man's hell
This may be a bit biased
But it's not unreasonable
Write here
Will naturally think of our country
Due to the serious implementation of the family planning policy
The demographic structure of our country is also changing
The proportion of elderly people is increasing
Although our material foundation cannot keep up with Western society
But we have our own traditional virtues
There are so many healthy things in society
We should create a good living environment for the elderly
Make them happy
Warm
Spend your old age in harmony
